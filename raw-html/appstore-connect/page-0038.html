<h1>Set a tax category for In-App Purchases</h1>
<p>In-App Purchases use by default the tax category set for the app. To learn how to set the tax category for your app, visit <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/set-a-tax-category">Set a tax category</a>. You can choose to set a different tax category for your In-App Purchase if necessary.</p>
<p>Changes to your In-App Purchase’s tax category only affect future transactions and won’t affect the price of your In-App Purchase.</p>
