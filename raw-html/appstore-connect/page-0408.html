<p>This is a routing or clearing number, but a different field will display depending on the location of your country or region. If you don’t know this information, other search criteria are available to locate your bank in App Store Connect, such as Bank Name, City, and Postal Code. If you can’t identify your bank in App Store Connect, it may be that Apple can’t send payments to that bank.</p>

<p>Bank Account Number</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>An account number can be found on your checks or statements and must be in English letters or numbers only. Keep in mind that some bank account numbers have leading zeros, so be sure to include all leading zeros. If you have an IBAN, your bank account number and your IBAN are two separate numbers. Don’t enter your IBAN into the bank account number field.</p>

<p>The Account Holder Name for your account. This must be entered in English letters or numbers, or Katakana for accounts based in Japan. It is important that the name matches exactly as it appears on the bank account you're using, including punctuations. If your account is a joint account, both names should be included in the Account Holder Name field. In addition to the 26 English characters and 10 digits, only the characters ,/?-)( are permitted.</p>
<p>The account holder name for your bank account doesn’t have to match the legal entity name for your agreement</p>
