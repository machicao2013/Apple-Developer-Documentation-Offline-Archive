<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Withholding Tax.</b> Withholding tax represents amounts withheld by Apple and remitted to taxing authorities in accordance with government requirements specific to the country or region. Withholding taxes can vary based on your location, the completion of any optional tax forms and the tax treaties entered into by your country or region. Visit <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-tax-information/provide-tax-information">Provide tax information</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Input Taxes.</b> Input taxes are amounts added to your payment to meet your tax requirements in certain countries or regions. For example, Goods and Services Tax (GST) applies if you're based in Australia on the basis you're registered for GST.</p>

<p>Exchange Rate</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This is the exchange rate at the time of payment, used to calculate total proceeds in your bank account currency. The exchange rate is only displayed if the payment for the report month selected has been disbursed.</p>
<p>Per Schedule 2 to your Developer Agreement, our bank converts payment amounts into the currency of your bank account. The exchange rate is established by our bank and, due to Apple’s volume, is generally a more favorable rate than used by your local bank. The rates are typically the spot rate on the date of payment and no more than three business days prior to the date the proceeds are received into your account.</p>

<p><b>Total Estimated Proceeds.</b> This is displayed if payment to you has not yet been made. This is the estimated amount of proceeds that will be dispersed in your bank account currency.</p>
<p>If iTunes doesn't have an exchange rate for a particular currency, the amount is converted to USD by default. This is for display purposes only, and payment will be made in your chosen bank account currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Proceeds.</b> This is displayed if payment has been transferred to your bank account. This is the actual amount of proceeds paid for the corresponding region and report period. Values are displayed in your bank account currency.</p>
