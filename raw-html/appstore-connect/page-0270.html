<h1>Manage distribution on an alternative app marketplace</h1>
<p>If you choose to distribute your app on an alternative app marketplace, you’ll need to add the marketplace in App Store Connect. Share your Developer ID with the marketplace developer so they can use it to generate and give you a marketplace token. Enter this token in App Store Connect to verify your relationship with the marketplace and add them to your account.</p>
<p>You can then manage which apps you want to make eligible for distribution on that marketplace, enable notifications for the marketplace, and provide the marketplace developer with the app’s alternative distribution package so they can distribute your app. You can choose to give them the alternative distribution package ID, send them the package, or set up notifications so Apple notifies them when the ID is available (if the marketplace supports notifications).</p>
