<td colspan="8">
<p>Chinese law requires additional documentation for some apps to be available on the App Store in China mainland.</p>
<p>China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) requires that some apps possess a valid Internet Content Provider (ICP) Filing Number. The ICP number and metadata on the App Information page should match with the information you have filed with MIIT. This match is required for your Simplified Chinese localization; if not configured, then it should match your primary language. Once the provided ICP Filing Number is verified and saved, it will be displayed on your App Store product page.</p>
<p>In addition, games must secure an approval number and apps with books and magazine content must secure an internet publishing permit from China’s National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA). Apps with religious content must secure an Internet Religious Information Permit from China’s National Religious Affairs Administration (NRAA). Apps with news content must obtain an Internet News Information Permit from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). If you offer or plan to offer any of these on the App Store in China mainland, you must provide the required information along with one or more supporting documents.If applicable, provide the required ICP filing information in the designated section under the “App Information” tab. To help verify your approval number, upload your game’s ISBN Issuing Letter or Approval Reply, and a copy of your latest Business License. Additionally, you can include an authorization agreement from the matching operator. To help verify your publishing permit, upload your internet publishing permit or other relevant permit from the NPPA, a publishing permit authorization letter from the authorizing party, a business license, an ICP license, or similar supporting documentation. To help verify your Internet Religious Information Permit, upload your Internet Religious Information Permit, a permit authorization letter from the authorizing party, a business license, an ICP license, or similar supporting documentation.
