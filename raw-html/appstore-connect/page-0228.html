<h1>Provide tax information</h1>
<p>To receive payments from Apple, you'll also need to <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-banking-information/enter-banking-information">enter banking information</a> and submit tax forms in accordance to local laws. App Store Connect will verify the information you provide.</p>
<p>In order to submit tax forms, you first need to sign the <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-agreements/sign-and-update-agreements">Paid Apps Agreement</a>. The required tax forms will display, many of which can be submitted electronically.</p>
<p>All developers must complete a US tax form to comply with the Paid Apps Agreement. Depending on where your developer account is based, you may be required to submit additional tax forms. Review the list of countries below to understand any other requirements that may be applicable to you.</p>
<div class="spacing-top">
<p><b>US-based</b></p>
<p>If you’re based in the United States, you’re prompted to complete a W-9 form. The US tax form section will display a field for a tax identification number.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For an individual, this is a Social Security Number (SSN), which is also an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a business entity, the taxpayer identification number is the Employer Identification Number (EIN).</p>

<p><b>Non-US-based</b></p>
<p>If you’re based outside the United States, the W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, or W-8ECI may be required, but you'll be prompted to answer a series of questions to direct you to the most appropriate tax form and any applicable certification. If your tax form isn’t available to you in App Store Connect, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>
