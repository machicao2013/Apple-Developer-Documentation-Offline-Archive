<h1>Generate a shared secret to verify receipts</h1>
<p>Include a shared secret in your request to verify App Store subscription or In-App Purchase receipts to increase security between your server and Apple's servers.</p>
<p>A shared secret is a 32-character hexadecimal string generated in App Store Connect. You may generate a primary shared secret, which is a single code for all your apps, or an app-specific shared secret for individual apps. You may also use a primary shared secret for some of your apps, and an app-specific shared secret for others.</p>
<p>For information about incorporating a shared secret into your app’s receipt handling, visit <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/original_api_for_in-app_purchase/validating_receipts_with_the_app_store">Validating Receipts with the App Store</a>.</p>
