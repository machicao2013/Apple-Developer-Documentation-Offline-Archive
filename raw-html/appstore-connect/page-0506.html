<p>It can take up to two business days for the app transfer to complete, during which the <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-and-submission-statuses">app status</a> is Processing App Transfer.</p>
<p>If the app requires <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/overview-of-export-compliance">export compliance documentation</a>, its status will be Waiting for Export Compliance until the appropriate documentation is reviewed by Apple. We’ll reach out to you directly to request documentation, or, alternatively, you may <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/topic/SC1110/subtopic/30067/solution/select">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>While the app is in this state, the transferor can’t edit the app metadata, rights, pricing, or In-App Purchases. Any open App Review communications are closed. If the app is part of a Game Center group, you can’t make changes to the group.</p>
<p>When the transfer is complete, both Account Holders are notified and the app no longer appears in the transferor’s App Store Connect account.</p>
<p>You can cancel an app transfer in <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/go/itunesconnect/contracts" target="_blank">Business</a> while it's still in the Waiting for Recipient state. In the App Transfers section, click Review. Then, on the App Transfer page, click Decline. The transferor can also cancel the transfer.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>After an app transfer, you must create new provisioning profiles in the recipient's Apple Developer account. Ensure you associate these profiles with the transferred app's App ID and distribution certificate.</p>
