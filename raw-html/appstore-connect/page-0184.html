<h1>View and edit In-App Purchase information</h1>
<p>You can edit most metadata elements for your In-App Purchases, except for the product ID and purchase type. If your In-App Purchase was never submitted to Apple for review, you can make changes to its metadata. However, if your In-App Purchase was already submitted, some changes require approval by App Review.</p>
