<h1>Manage European Union Digital Services Act trader requirements</h1>
<p>Articles 30 and 31 of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2022:277:FULL&amp;from=EN">Digital Services Act (DSA)</a> require Apple to verify and display trader contact information for all traders distributing apps on the App Store in the European Union (EU). This includes an address, phone number, and email address that you provide to Apple for the purpose of posting on your App Store product page in accordance with the DSA. Once verified, Apple will publish this information on your App Store product page when your app is distributed in any of the <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/easy-read_en">27 territories</a> of the EU. Even if you don’t distribute apps in the EU, you’ll still need to declare a trader status.</p>
<p>If you haven't already confirmed your trader status, next time you submit a new app in App Store Connect you’ll be asked to disclose whether or not you’re a trader in connection with the DSA in order to stay compliant across territories when distributing on the App Store. You'll need to confirm your trader status if you have at least one app on the App Store in the EU that qualifies you as a trader. You’ll then have the option to turn off or specify your trader status for each specific app that you distribute. If you’re not a trader, consumers in the EU will be informed that consumer rights stemming from applicable consumer protection laws won’t apply to contracts between you and them.</p>

<h2>Trader self-assessment</h2>
<p>You must assess whether you're a trader for EU law purposes. If you don't distribute apps on the App Store in the EU (for example you only distribute apps through alternative distribution, or TestFlight, or on the App Store only outside the EU), you're not acting as a trader on the App Store. Apple can't determine whether you're a trader.</p>

<div class="spacing-top">
<h2>How to know if you’re a trader</h2>
<p>The DSA defines a trader as “any natural person, or any legal person irrespective of whether privately or publicly owned, who is acting, including through any person acting in his or her name or on his or her behalf, for purposes relating to his or her trade, business, craft or profession.”</p>
<p>The European Commission (EC) has issued a <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021XC1229(05)">Notice</a> on what constitutes a trader (See Section 2.2. “Concept of Trader"), though it is not specific to digital commerce. The EC has also published <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/55e73447-8c21-4728-a42b-05bd030f7627_en?filename=Legal%20brief%203.pdf">Guidance</a> in the digital commerce context, from the perspective of when an ”influencer“ may be considered a trader.</p>
<p>To determine if you're a trader, you should consider a range of non-exhaustive and non-exclusive factors (see those listed on page 2 in the EC’s Guidance), which may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whether you make revenue as a result of your app, for example if your app includes In-App Purchases, or if it's a paid or ad-sponsored app — especially if you're transacting in large volumes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether you engage in commercial practices towards consumers, including advertising, or promoting products or services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether you're registered for VAT purposes; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether you develop your app in connection with your trade, business, craft, or profession—meaning that you’re acting in a professional/business capacity. You're unlikely to be a trader for EU law purposes if you're acting “for purposes which are outside your trade, business, craft, or profession.” For example, if you're a hobbyist and you developed your app with no intention of commercializing it, you may not be considered a trader.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of whether you’re an individual developer or organization, if you have a legal status associated with a business activity, that would suggest you may be a trader.</p>
<p>The material contained herein is informational, general in nature, and does not constitute legal advice. If you're uncertain about your status as a trader, consult with your legal advisor.</p>
