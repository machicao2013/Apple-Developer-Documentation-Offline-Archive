<h1>Manage challenges</h1>
<p>Leaderboards allow players to measure and track their game progress. However, some players find it more engaging to top a friend’s score and challenge each other directly. Game Center facilitates this through challenges.</p>
<p>Challenges are built on top of leaderboards and allow players to connect with their friends and participate in time-limited competitions. Players receive notifications when their friends challenge them or pass their score on a leaderboard.</p>
<p>You can create up to 20 challenges per app. Challenges must be approved before they are available to players. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-game-center-components">Learn how to submit Game Center components for review.</a></p>
