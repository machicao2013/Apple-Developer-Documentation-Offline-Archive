<h1>Reply to App Review messages</h1>
<p>If App Review or TestFlight App Review rejects your app, you can communicate with Apple and resolve issues in the App Review section.</p>
<p>When your app is rejected, you'll get a message containing information about the rejection, including how it violates the <a href="/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Review Guidelines</a> or Notarization Review Guidelines. You can correspond with Apple, and include attachments, such as screenshots and supporting documents, until you resubmit to App Review. If your app was rejected for a metadata issue, you can resubmit the same build after resolving the issue.</p>
