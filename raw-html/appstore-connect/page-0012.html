<h1>Manage groups</h1>
<p>A group must contain at least one app. Once you create a group from an app, you can add additional apps to it to share leaderboards, achievements, and challenges data. Learn how to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/creating-activities-for-your-game">share activities’ data using App Store Connect API</a>.</p>
<p>When you add an app with existing Game Center components to a group, you can choose which of those existing leaderboards, achievements, and challenges to add to the group. Once added, these components are defined in the group as they were in the app prior to being grouped. Combining these Game Center components will replace the version in the app with the one you choose from the group. App Store Connect simplifies this process by presenting only compatible components and available options at each step. The options that App Store Connect presents to you're dependent on your app and group data. Types of assets (for example, leaderboard sets) that the app doesn’t have won't display.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Apps can only belong to one Game Center group. If you wish to add your app to a new group, it must be removed from any existing groups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you add live leaderboards, achievements, and challenges to a group, they stay live without submitting an app version.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidelines for moving achievements</h2>
<p>There are no restrictions for adding achievements to a group; however, the following remain true:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The maximum number of points for each achievement is 100.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The total maximum number of points for a single app's achievements is 1000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no restrictions on the total points for all group achievements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h2>Guidelines for moving challenges</h2>
<p>Challenge can only be moved to a group with its associated leaderboard.</p>
