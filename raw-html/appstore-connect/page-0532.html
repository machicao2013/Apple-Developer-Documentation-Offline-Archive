<h1>View acquisition sources</h1>
<p>App Analytics lets you view data based on where users discover your app or App Clip, so you can determine which sources are most successful at helping you acquire users.</p>
<p>When a user taps a link from an app, website, or App Clip card that directs them to your App Store product page, the immediate product page view is attributed to the referring app, website, or App Clip. If the user subsequently downloads the app for the first time, the resulting First-Time Download is attributed to the original source.</p>
<p>All sales and <span class="force-glossary">usage data</span>  for your app or App Clip are attributed to the initial download source recorded when a user first taps to download the app or launch the App Clip. This includes data from redownloads, downloads to multiple devices sharing the same Apple Account, subscription renewals, and Family Sharing downloads.</p>

<h3>View App Clip metrics by invocation source</h3>
<div>
<p>Viewing your App Clip metrics by invocation source can help you determine which sources are most successful at driving app downloads and engaging users.</p>
<p>Metrics for App Clips, such as App Clip Card Views, App Clip Installations, App Clip Sessions, and App Clip Crashes, are attributed to the initial source that presented the App Clip card to the user. These metrics are only available from users who have agreed to share their diagnostics and usage information with app developers.</p>
<p>Default App Clip experience invocations include Messages and Web Referrer sources. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/configuring_your_app_clip_s_launch_experience">Learn more.</a></p>

</sf-symbol> FAQs</h3>
<div>
<h3>How are the metrics driven by Apple Ads (such as app downloads, product page views, and impressions) attributed in App Analytics?</h3>
<p>When a user searches for your app using keywords in the Search tab of the App Store and your search results ad appears in the results, the metrics are included in Search totals. If a user doesn’t enter any keywords in Search, and your search results ad appears on the Search page by default, the metrics  are included in Browse totals.</p>
<p>For a guided walkthrough of Apple Ads reporting, check out the “Maximize campaign results with insights” lesson in <a href="https://ads.apple.com/app-store/certification">Apple Ads Certification</a>.</p>
<h3>Why is there a spike in downloads attributed to Institutional Purchases in my App Analytics data?</h3>
<p>When your app is <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/set-distribution-methods">public</a>, it'll be publicly available on the App Store in the countries or regions you selected and available to anyone for volume purchase through Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager. Volume purchases generally result in large spikes of downloads because content is purchased in bulk and directly assigned to devices or accounts within a business or educational institution.</p>
<p>Review the <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/reporting/summary-sales-report">Promo Code field in the Sales and Trends Summary Sales Report</a> to confirm if a spike in downloads is due to a volume purchase for business transaction through Apple Business Manager or volume purchase for education transaction through Apple School Manager. Learn more about purchasing content in <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-manager/intro-to-buying-content-axme19b23f7f/1/web/1">Apple Business Manager</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-school-manager/intro-to-buying-content-axme19b23f7f/web">Apple School Manager</a>.</p>
