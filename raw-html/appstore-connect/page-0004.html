<h1>Manage achievements</h1>
<p>When setting up achievements in App Store Connect, you define the criteria that players must meet to earn them. Specify the points awarded for each achievement and decide whether the achievement should remain hidden until it’s earned. Indicate if the achievement can be earned multiple times by the same player.</p>
<p>For each language or region in which your app will appear, provide a title for each achievement along with descriptions for both pre- and post-earning states. These help keep players engaged during gameplay. Additionally, include an image to visually represent each achievement. You can create up to 100 achievements per app.</p>
<p>Achievements must be approved before they are available to players. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-game-center-components">Learn how to submit Game Center components for review.</a></p>
