<h1>In-App Purchase statuses</h1>
<p>The <em>In-App Purchase status</em> indicates whether your In-App Purchase is available or if it needs your attention.</p>
<p>In-App Purchase products have statuses such as “Ready to Submit” or “Approved” or a status indicator. The status tells you immediately whether your product needs attention.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A red status indicator (<img alt="" class="help-app-status help-app-status-small no-margin-right" src="/help/images/icons/status-red-icon_2x.png"/>) means that you need to perform some action before a product can be made available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A yellow status indicator (<img alt="" class="help-app-status help-app-status-small no-margin-right" src="/help/images/icons/status-yellow-icon_2x.png"/>) means that some process is ongoing, controlled either by you or by Apple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A green status indicator (<img alt="" class="help-app-status help-app-status-small no-margin-right" src="/help/images/icons/status-green-icon_2x.png"/>) means that the In-App Purchase is available.</p>
