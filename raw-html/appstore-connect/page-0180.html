<h1>Set a price for an In-App Purchase</h1>
<p>In order to offer paid content on the App Store, your membership Account Holder will need to accept the Paid Apps Agreement in the Business section of App Store Connect. If the most recent version of this agreement hasn’t been accepted, you can only offer your app for free.</p>
<p>You’ll need to set pricing for your In-App Purchase before you submit it for review. Choose from up to 800 price points by default, and request to access an additional 100 higher price points (up to $10,000).</p>
<p>You can set a price for the country or region you’re familiar with as the basis for automatically generating prices across the other 174 storefronts and 43 currencies. Automatically generated prices account for foreign exchange rates and certain taxes, and follow the most common pricing convention for each country or region.</p>
<p>Periodically, Apple updates prices in certain regions based on changes in taxes and foreign exchange rates. This is done using publicly available exchange rate information from financial data providers. These automatic price adjustments help ensure that your app’s price across all storefronts stays equalized with your base country or region. Automatic price updates help your global earnings stay consistent, customers aren’t incentivized to seek lower prices on certain storefronts, and pricing mistakes are reduced. Apple will never change the price in your base country or region, and will always notify you in advance of changes on other storefronts.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can choose to manually manage certain storefronts or you can manually manage them all. Keep in mind that you'll be responsible for staying up to date with taxes and exchange rates in the storefronts you manually manage.</p>

<h3>Edit base country or region for your In-App Purchase</h3>
<div>
<p>You can set the base country or region of each In-App Purchase separately from the app. Once you edit the base country or region or update the pricing of an In-App Purchase, it'll no longer inherit changes you make to the app’s base country or region.</p>
