<h1>Invite external testers</h1>
<p>External testers are people you invite to test your app who aren’t App Store Connect users. After uploading your build, you can invite up to 10,000 external testers per app. To make your build available for external testing, you need to create an external group, add builds, and invite testers using their email addresses or by sharing a <a href="/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/invite-external-testers#invite-testers-using-a-public-link">public invitation link.</a></p>
<p>When inviting testers via a public link, you can set tester criteria, such as device and OS requirements, ensuring only qualified testers can accept the invitation. This facilitates the enrollment of relevant testers, who can then provide feedback for your beta app. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/invite-external-testers#invite-testers-using-a-public-link">Learn how to set tester criteria when inviting testers using a public link</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that:</p>
<ul class="compound-item-list">
<li>
<p>To create an external group for external testing, you must first create an internal group for internal testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Builds uploaded as TestFlight Internal Only from Xcode or Xcode Cloud are marked as internal under the build number and can only be added to internal tester groups.</p>
