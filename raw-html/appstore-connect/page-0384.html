<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>Reference Name</p>
</td>
<td colspan="8">
<p>A unique name you give to your In-App Purchase for internal tracking that's not visible to customers, but used in App Store Connect and Sales and Trends reports. The reference name can include any characters and can be as long as 64 characters.</p>
<p>The reference name can be edited at any time without review.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td colspan="4">
<p>Product ID</p>
</td>
<td colspan="8">
<p>A unique ID specific to your app that you can assign to your In-App Purchases to uniquely identify them within your app.</p>
<p>The product ID can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, periods, and underscores, and can be as long as 100 characters. You need separate identifiers for In-App Purchases in your iOS apps and your macOS apps.</p>
<p>When your app uses StoreKit to communicate with the App Store, it uses product IDs to retrieve the configuration data you provided for each In-App Purchase. When a user wants to make a purchase, your app identifies the In-App Purchase using its product ID.</p>
<p>The product ID isn't editable after you save the In-App Purchase.</p>
<p>Once a product ID is assigned to an in-app puchase, it can't be reused for another In-App Purchase within the same app, even if you delete the original In-App Purchase with that ID.</p>

<h2 class="spacing-top">Localizable information</h2>
<p>Add localizable In-App Purchases information used in the product display. You must include these properties for at least one language. For a list of languages, visit <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-store-localizations">App Store localizations</a>.</p>
<p>Changes to the localized information require review. The existing text displays on the store until the new text is approved. The change has its own status separate from the overall status of the In-App Purchase. Before your changes are reviewed, you can revert the change.</p>
