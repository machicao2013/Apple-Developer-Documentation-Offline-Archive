<h1>Create a new version</h1>
<p>When you’re ready to distribute a new version of your app, you create a version using the same app record you created for the original version.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it's not possible to revert to a previous version on the App Store if you have an issue with your app. You must create and submit a new version. Ensure that the current version status is Ready for Distribution to initiate a new version.</p>
