<h1>Overview of Game Center groups</h1>
<p>You can add two or more apps to Game Center group to share leaderboards, achievements, challenges, and activities’ data in App Store Connect.</p>
<p>When you add an app with existing Game Center components to a group, you can choose which leaderboards, achievements, challenges, and activities to retain as part of the group. App Store Connect guides you through this process by presenting only compatible assets and options at each step.</p>
<p>You can define leaderboards, achievements, challenges, and activities for a group in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define the Game Center components for an individual app; then, when you move the app to a group, you specify how the app's Game Center components are added to the group Game Center components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add an app to a group that already has leaderboards, achievements, challenges, and activities defined. The app uses the existing group Game Center components. Like apps, groups can organize leaderboards into sets. If a group uses leaderboard sets, apps you add to the group either already use leaderboard sets or can’t have any leaderboards defined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An app can belong to only one group, but there are no restrictions on the types of apps within a group. For example, you can create a group containing iOS and macOS apps that share the same leaderboards, achievements, challenges, and activities. There’s no limit to the number of groups per account or to the number of apps that can belong to a group.</p>
<p>When you're ready to release a version of your app that belongs to a group, decide which draft group leaderboards, achievements, challenges, and activities will go live with the app. If you add live leaderboards, achievements, challenges, and activities to a group, they'll stay live without submitting an app version. In addition, you set the app’s multiplayer compatibility options to include the other apps in the group. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/manage-an-app-version-for-game-center">Learn how to manage an app version for Game Center.</a></p>
