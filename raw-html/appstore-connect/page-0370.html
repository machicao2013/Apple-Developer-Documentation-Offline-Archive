<h1>Leaderboards</h1>
<p>In App Store Connect, leaderboard metadata defines each leaderboard, outlines score details, and manages language-specific text for display. The platform also tracks the leaderboard type and shows the approval status, indicating if it’s live with the app.</p>
<p>Set these properties in the Leaderboard section of the Game Center page for an app, as described in <a href="/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/manage-leaderboards">Manage leaderboards</a>.</p>

<p>Score Range</p>
</td>

<p>The score range using 64-bit signed integers. The values must be between the long min (-2^63) and long max (2^63 - 1). Any scores outside of this range are deleted. Score range values are optional, but if they’re added, both values must be set and they must not be equal. When first adding a score range, or when changing it in the future to a smaller range that will restrict data, all data outside of the range is lost and can’t be recovered.</p>
