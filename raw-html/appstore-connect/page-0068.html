<li>
<p>In the sidebar, click Product Page Optimization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you haven’t created a test before, click Create Test. If you've previously created a test, click the add button (+) next to Product Page Optimization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a reference name to help you identify the test when monitoring results in App Analytics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the number of treatments you want to create. You can have up to three treatments per test. Please note that the more treatments you add to a test, the longer the test may take to reach a conclusive result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose a traffic proportion. This is the percentage of users that’ll be randomly shown a test treatment instead of your original product page. For example, if a test has three treatments and you choose a 30% traffic proportion, each treatment will be shown to 10% of the total traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the localizations you want to include in your test. By default, all localizations that your app supports are selected. If the localization shown to a user is excluded from your test, the user won’t be included in the test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To view how long it might take to reach your goal, click the arrow next to Estimate Your Test Duration and choose your desired improvement in conversion rate. We use your app’s existing performance data, such as daily impressions and new downloads, to generate this estimate. The estimated duration and impressions needed will appear. This estimate is provided as a guide and won’t impact the test. A test runs for 90 days or until you manually stop it within that time. Keep in mind that it may not be possible to reach your desired improvement in conversion rate within 90 days.</p>
