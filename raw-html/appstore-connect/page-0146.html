<h1>Upload app previews and screenshots</h1>
<p>Use screenshots and app previews to visually communicate your app’s user experience. You can upload screenshots and app previews on the platform section of your app’s page in App Store Connect when the app has one of the following statuses:</p>
<ul class="compound-item-list">
<li>
<p>Prepare for Submission</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ready for Review</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Rejected</p>

<p>If your app's user interface is the same across multiple device sizes and localizations, provide only the highest resolution screenshots required. They automatically scale down to smaller device sizes.</p>
<p>If you prefer not to use scaled versions, you can add specific screenshots and app previews for other device sizes and localizations using Media Manager. If a localized app preview is missing for <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/localize-app-information">your localized metadata</a>, the app preview in the next best available language will be used on App Store product pages and displayed to users when they install your app.</p>

<p><code>.mov</code>, <code>.m4v</code>, <code>.mp4</code> formats are accepted for app previews in H.264 and <code>.mov</code> format for ProRes 422 (HQ only).</p>
