<h1>Overview of publishing your app on the App Store</h1>
<p>This outlines the general workflow for publishing an app to the App Store.</p>
<div class="Subhead">
<h2>Step 1: Choose your build</h2>
<p>An app can have several versions, and each version can have multiple builds. To publish your app, <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/choose-a-build-to-submit">choose which build to submit for review</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h2>Step 2: Set pricing and availability for the App Store</h2>
<p>You must <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-pricing/set-a-price">set a price</a> and <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/set-a-tax-category">tax category</a> for your app. By default, your app is available in all <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-store-localizations">App Store localizations</a>, but you can <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/manage-availability-for-your-app-on-the-app-store">choose specific regions</a> if needed. You also have the option to <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/publish-for-pre-order">publish your app for pre-order</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h2>Step 3: Submit your app for review</h2>
<p><a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/overview-of-submitting-for-review">Submit your app for review</a> to start the App Review process and make it available on the App Store. Before submission, <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/required-localizable-and-editable-properties">complete all required metadata</a>, and decide whether to <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/select-an-app-store-version-release-option">release your app manually, automatically</a>, or <a href="/help/app-store-connect/update-your-app/release-a-version-update-in-phases">in phases</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h2>Step 4: View your app status and resolve review issues</h2>
<p>Once you submit your app, its status changes to Waiting for Review. If any issues are found, <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/reply-to-app-review-messages">read and reply to App Review communications</a>. After your app is approved, it can take up to 24 hours to go live on the App Store.</p>
</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h2>Step 5: Request promo codes for the App Store</h2>
<p>After your app is approved, you can <a href="/help/app-store-connect/offer-promo-codes/request-and-manage-promo-codes">request promo codes</a> to distribute to users before you make your app available on the App Store. Distribute these codes through email or other methods. Users can redeem them when purchasing the app on the App Store.</p>
