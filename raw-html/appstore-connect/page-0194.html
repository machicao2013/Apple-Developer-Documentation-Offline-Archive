<h1>Submit a custom product page</h1>
<p>Custom product pages, and their associated metadata like deep links, must be reviewed before they’re visible to users on the App Store.</p>
<p>If you want to submit a custom product page and your app hasn’t been approved yet, include the custom product page in the same submission as your first iOS app version. If your app is already approved, you can choose to submit a custom product page with or without an iOS app version. You can also add other items to a submission.</p>

<p>You can’t modify a custom product page's screenshots, previews, promotional text, or keywords, while it's under review. Withdrawing the submission makes the page editable, so you can make changes and resubmit.</p>
<p>After an app submission is approved, users can access the custom product page URL.</p>
