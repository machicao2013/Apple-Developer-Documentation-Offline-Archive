<h1>Manage leaderboards</h1>
<p>Leaderboards help encourage friendly competition within your game. When you configure leaderboards in App Store Connect, you specify details such as the scores to collect and how to order them. For each language you want a leaderboard to display in, you specify the leaderboard name, score format, and score unit. You can also include a localized image to illustrate the score in the leaderboard.</p>
<p>There are two types of leaderboards that can be created:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Classic leaderboards:</b> A leaderboard where score data will never reset unless the leaderboard is deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Recurring leaderboards:</b> A leaderboard where score data will continually be reset based on set preferences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The limit to how many leaderboards you can create per app differs based on whether it’s with or without <a href="/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/manage-leaderboard-sets">leaderboard sets</a>:</p>
<p>Without Leaderboard sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Up to 100 leaderboards per app</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With Leaderboard sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Up to 500 leaderboards total per app</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maximum 100 leaderboard sets per app</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximum 100 leaderboards per set</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaderboards must be approved before they are available to players. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-game-center-components">Learn how to submit Game Center components for review.</a></p>
