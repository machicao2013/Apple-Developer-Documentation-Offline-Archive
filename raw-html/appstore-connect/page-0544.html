</sf-symbol> FAQs</h3>
<div>
<h3>Why don't my reports from Sales and Trends match up with reports from Payments and Financial Reports?</h3>
<p>Sales and Trends provides next-day data so that you can view the performance of your app and In-App Purchases, while Payments and Financial Reports provide final proceeds. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/measure-app-performance/overview-of-reporting-tools">Learn about differences in reporting.</a></p>
<h3>Why do some transactions show zero proceeds, even though my app isn't free?</h3>
<p>Your reports include information about app updates. Updates are always free and are identified by Product Type Identifier 7. App sales will show Product Type Identifier 1 and can either be free or paid.</p>
<h3>Why are there refunds for an amounts that are less than the customer price?</h3>
<p>Customers who have paid for subscriptions may get prorated or partial refunds to factor in the content they’ve already received.</p>
