<h1>View product page optimization results</h1>
<p>Optimize your App Store product page to determine the most effective version for driving app downloads. These tests use a range of modern and rigorous Bayesian techniques and require minimal overhead to launch a test, transparently communicate changing results as they arrive, and identify the best version as quickly as possible.  This methodology is designed by Apple specifically for App Store product page data, so you can evaluate results every day with the confidence that you’re receiving the most accurate and up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Test results appear in App Analytics after there are five first-time downloads associated with the test. Once a test gathers enough impressions for 90% confidence, a treatment may be marked as Performing Better or Performing Worse, compared to your chosen baseline. (This baseline is the original product page by default, and can be changed to a treatment at any time.) The main measure of performance for each product page version is the conversion rate — the estimated percentage of users that downloaded or pre-ordered your app after viewing the product page. If the amount of data required to reach a high confidence level is more than you’ll likely receive based on your test’s traffic partway through the test, we’ll let you know that your test may be inconclusive.</p>
<p>Test results provide the estimated conversion rate for each variant, the estimated conversion lift between variants, and Apple's confidence level in the results. To calculate this data, Apple takes into account a range of prior information about the performance of your app’s product page. This helps ensure that there’s enough data to report on a difference between your variants.</p>

<p>Product page optimization helps you evaluate which version of your product page is most effective at getting users to download your app.</p>
<ol class="compound-item-list">
<li>
<p>In App Analytics, select the app you want to view.</p>

<li>
<p>Click the Acquisition tab.</p>

<p>In the top menu bar, click Product Pages.</p>

<p>The overview of your test’s performance, includes an estimate of which treatment is performing best. By default, your original product page is the baseline. If your test includes multiple treatments, you can change the baseline to one of those treatments. Use the Improvement switch to display results by Improvement or Conversion Rate. Use the menu to view different test results.</p>
<p>Once a test gathers enough impressions to have at least 90% confidence in the results, you can label a treatment as either Performing Better or Performing Worse compared to your chosen baseline. The default baseline is your original product page, but you may change it at any time to any of the available treatments.</p>
