<h1>Overview of App Clips</h1>
<p>An App Clip is a small part of your app that’s discoverable at the moment it’s needed and lets people quickly start and finish a task from your app. Users running iOS 14 or later can quickly access App Clips without needing to download the full app. <a href="/app-clips/" target="_blank">Learn about App Clips</a>.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>App Clips are subject to the same <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/set-an-app-age-rating/">age restrictions</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/105121">parental controls</a> as full apps. However, App Clips aren’t available to children under 13 or those with <a href="https://support.apple.com/105055">Ask to Buy</a> enabled, regardless of other restrictions and settings. To access all of an app’s features, such as those normally offered through <a href="/help/app-store-connect/offer-app-clip-experiences/generate-app-clip-codes">App Clip codes</a> and <a href="/help/app-store-connect/offer-app-clip-experiences/offer-a-default-app-clip-experience">QR codes</a>, these users must install the full app.</p>
</div>
<p>You can configure how your App Clip is discovered and launched by creating App Clip experiences. Each experience includes metadata for the App Clip card, an invocation URL, and various invocation methods. You can create many App Clip experiences to support situations when different tasks from your app might be helpful.</p>
<p>A default App Clip experience is required and can be invoked using Safari and Messages, as well as through an NFC tag, QR code, and links in other apps when using an Apple-provided App Clip link.</p>
<p>You can also create advanced App Clip experiences, which let you configure your App Clip to use multiple domains, associate your App Clip with physical locations, and customize multiple App Clip cards to represent different businesses with a single App Clip. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/configuring_your_app_clip_s_launch_experience">Learn about configuration options.</a></p>
<p>When you’re ready to submit your app for review to distribute on the App Store, you can optionally provide up to three URLs that are representative of experiences your App Clip provides, allowing App Review to understand the features and functionalities. Add these URLs in the App Clips URLs section in App Review Information toward the bottom of the Version Information page.</p>
<p>To edit the App Clip section in App Store Connect, you must first upload a build that includes an App Clip. Ensure that each subsequent app version you submit includes the App Clip to maintain its availability for users.</p>
