<h1>Download financial reports</h1>
<p>Financial reports show your monthly proceeds, as well as final unit sales by country or region and order type. They’re automatically generated once a month, based on Apple’s <a href="https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wa/jumpTo?page=fiscalcalendar" target="_blank">fiscal calendar</a>, and are only generated if there are purchases or refunds during that fiscal period.</p>
<p>Financial reports for the previous fiscal month's earnings are available by the first Friday of the current fiscal month. You can sign up to receive email notifications as soon as your financial reports are available each month. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/view-and-edit-your-profile#set-email-notifications">Learn more.</a> Financial reports remain available for a period of ten years from the reporting date.</p>
<p>You can manually download reports from App Store Connect. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi">Learn how to download sales and financial reports using the App Store Connect API.</a></p>
<p>There are four types of reports available.</p>
<div class="Subhead">
<h2>All Countries or Regions (Detailed)</h2>
<p>This detailed financial report covers all locations in which you have sales on the App Store and includes the transaction and settlement dates for purchases. It’s available once all respective individual currency reports are available, starting with your March 2020 report.</p>
</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h2>All Countries or Regions (Single File)</h2>
<p>This consolidated financial report covers all locations in which you have sales on the App Store, and is based on processed and settled transactions during the Apple fiscal month. It’s available once all respective individual currency reports are available, starting with your March 2020 report.</p>
</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h2>All Countries or Regions (Multiple Files)</h2>
<p>Separate financial reports cover each location in which you have sales on the App Store and are based on processed and settled transactions during the Apple fiscal month. If you change the location where your products are available for sale, the number of reports you receive may increase or decrease accordingly. The introduction of new currencies for customers on the App Store may lead to more reports.</p>
</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h2>Transaction tax report (Single File)</h2>
<p>This summary report covers the sales tax, use tax, goods and services tax, and other similar taxes applied on your transactions in the US and Canada. The report is summarized at a tax rate and jurisdiction level, and is available the first full month after you've <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/set-a-tax-category/">configured your tax category settings</a>.</p>
