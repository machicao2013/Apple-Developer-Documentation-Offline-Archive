<p>In App Analytics, select the app you want to view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Retention.</p>
</li>

<p>The table shows the percentage of devices that used your app in the days following installation.</p>
<p>For example, if customers first downloaded your app on 100 devices on May 1, and 20 devices remain active,  with at least one session, on May 8, the retention rate is 20% (20 of 100 devices).</p>
