<h1>Test an App Clip experience</h1>
<p>App Clips allow you to make a small part of your app discoverable and quick to launch at the moment it’s needed. You can add up to three invocation URLs to launch different experiences within your App Clip. Testers running TestFlight for iOS, version 2.7 or later, and iOS 14 beta or later can test and provide feedback on all available App Clip experiences. Currently, testing of other invocation methods is not supported. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/testing_your_app_clip_s_launch_experience">Learn more about testing your App Clip’s launch experience.</a></p>
