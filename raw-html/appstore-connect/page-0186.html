<h1>Manage a submission with unresolved issues</h1>
<p>If any of the items in your submission are rejected, the submission status changes to Unresolved Issues. To consider a submission approved, App Review needs to approve all items. To continue with the accepted items, you need to either edit and resubmit, or remove the rejected items from the submission. When a submission has a status of Unresolved Issues, you can’t add more items to it.</p>
