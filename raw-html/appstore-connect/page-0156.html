<h1>Enter banking information</h1>
<p>To receive payments from Apple, you need to submit electronic <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/reporting/banking-information">banking information</a>. Note that in order to add banking information, you’ll first need to <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-agreements/sign-and-update-agreements">sign a Paid Apps Agreement</a>.</p>
<p>Provide information specific to your bank (not an intermediary or correspondent bank) and ensure the routing number is unique to your account.</p>
<p>In certain regions, additional documentation may be required to receive payments. If an Apple banking partner needs more documentation than what you provided, they’ll reach out to you directly. To verify a request before responding, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/finance/">contact us</a>. Apple may also request additional information.</p>
<p>You must submit all required tax forms needed for your paid contract in order for us to process banking information.</p>

<h3>Can I receive payments to multiple banks?</h3>
<p>No. You may only receive payments at one bank.</p>
<h3>Why am I getting a “Please enter valid bank account number” error message?</h3>
<p>If your bank account number has leading zeros, make sure you’ve included all leading zeros when entering your banking information. Your bank account number and your IBAN are two separate numbers. Make sure you haven’t entered your IBAN in the bank account number field.</p>
