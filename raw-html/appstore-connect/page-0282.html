<p>You can publicly respond to a review, edit your response, and delete your response for your app on the App Store. Only one response per review appears on your App Store product page.</p>
<p>Responses may take up to 24 hours to appear on the App Store. Until then, they’ll show as pending in App Store Connect. Edited responses will have notations indicating that they’ve been edited. Responses appear in iOS 10.3 or later, macOS 10.6.6 or later, and visionOS 1 or later.</p>
