<h1>Add internal testers</h1>
<p>Create a group and add up to 100 internal testers (<span class="no-glossary">App Store Connect</span> users with access to your content) to test your app using <span class="force-glossary">TestFlight</span>. You can choose to automatically distribute builds to internal groups or add them manually. Builds created by Xcode Cloud must be manually added to groups in App Store Connect. Builds uploaded as TestFlight Internal Only from Xcode or Xcode Cloud will be indicated as internal under the build number. You can only add builds with this indicator to internal tester groups—you can’t submit them for external testing or to customers.</p>
