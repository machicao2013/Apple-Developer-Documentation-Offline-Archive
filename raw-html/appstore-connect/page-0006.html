<h1>Manage activities</h1>
<p>Game activities encourage players to be engaged with your game and with each other by presenting them with in-game challenges, such as collecting puzzle pieces or completing daily tasks. Activities provide a way to link players directly to a specific mode or level making it easy for players to jump straight into the action with other players.</p>
<p>You can create up to 20 activities per app. Activities must be approved before they're available to players. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-game-center-components">Learn how to submit Game Center components for review.</a></p>
