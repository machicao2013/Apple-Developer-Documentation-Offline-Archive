<h3>Submit an In-App Purchase for the first time</h3>
<div>
<p>When submitting an In-App Purchase or subscription for the first time, you must submit it with a new app version. If there are multiple In-App Purchases or subscriptions related to that version, submit all of them together. Once App Review approves one or more In-App Purchases or subscriptions for your app, you can submit more In-App Purchases or subscriptions without a new app version.</p>
<ol class="compound-item-list">
<li>
<p>In Apps, select the app you want to view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the sidebar, click the app version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the right, scroll down to the In-App Purchases and Subscriptions section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Select In-App Purchases or Subscriptions, or if you’ve already started selecting In-App Purchases or subscriptions, click Edit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the “Add In-App Purchases or Subscriptions” dialog, select the In-App Purchases or subscriptions you want to submit.</p>

<li>
<p>Click done.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/overview-of-submitting-for-review">Submit your app for review</a> when you're ready. To automatically release your In-App Purchase or subscription upon approval, <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-in-app-purchases/set-availability-for-in-app-purchases"> choose at least one country or region </a> for availability. To submit your In-App Purchase or subscription for review without publishing it on the App Store, choose Remove from Sale.</p>
<p>Once App Review approves the In-App Purchase or subscription, its status updates to <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/in-app-purchases-and-subscriptions/in-app-purchase-statuses/">Developer Removed from Sale.</a></p>
<p>If you've already submitted an In-App Purchase or subscription with your app and later decide to add additional In-App Purchases or subscriptions, you can do so without resubmitting your app version.</p>
