<h1>Update your account for invoicing requirements</h1>
<p>Before your first invoice is issued, you will want to make sure you’ve updated your account for invoicing requirements. If you don’t update your account for invoicing requirements within 15 days after receiving the email notice, you may be invoiced without the applicable tax treatment applied or in the default currency. Additionally, you may not be able to access all App Store Connect features.</p>
