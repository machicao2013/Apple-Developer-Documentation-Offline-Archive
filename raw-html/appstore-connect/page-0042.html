<h1>Add a new app</h1>
<p>Before uploading a build of your app to App Store Connect, first create an app record in your App Store Connect account.</p>
<p>If you want to offer an app with multiple platforms as a single purchase, create it as a single record in App Store Connect. All platforms will share the same bundle ID, but you'll add <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/platform-version-information">platform-specific information</a> separately.</p>

<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>You can't add an app to your account until the Account Holder signs the latest agreement in the Business section.</p>

<p>Under User Access, choose Limited Access or Full Access. If you select Limited Access, choose the users who should be able to access this app.</p>
<p>Users with the Account Holder, Admin, Finance, and Access to Reports roles can view all apps because these roles can't have their app access limited.</p>

<h3 class="Name">Can I deliver my app information using the App Store Connect REST API?</h3>

<p>You can <a href="/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-platforms">add a platform to an app</a> to create a universal purchase.</p>
<h3 class="Name">What can I do if the app name I want to use on the App Store is unavailable?</h3>
<p>You can use an app name for one app per localization.</p>
