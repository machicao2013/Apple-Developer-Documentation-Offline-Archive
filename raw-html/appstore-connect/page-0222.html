<h1>Set up subscription offer codes</h1>
<p>If you offer auto-renewable subscriptions on the App Store, you can set up offer codes to provide people with a free or discounted price for a specific duration and help you acquire, retain, and win back subscribers. You can create codes for a maximum of 1 million redemptions per app, per
quarter.</p>
<p>There are two types of offer codes:</p>
<h3>One-time-use codes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p> Unique, one-time-use codes that customers redeem through a redemption URL, by entering the code in the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118242">App Store code redemption flow</a>, or within your app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers are limited to redeeming one code per offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redeemable by customers within your app if they’re using a device running iOS 14, iPadOS 14, or macOS 15, or later and your app supports the appropriate StoreKit method. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/supporting_subscription_offer_codes_in_your_app">Learn more</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Useful for small-scale distribution or when code access needs to be restricted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each app can have up to 1 million codes per quarter, shared across all subscriptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expire after a maximum of six months from the date they’re created.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Custom codes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Uniquely named custom codes — for example, SPRINGPROMO — that customers redeem through a redemption URL or within your app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers are limited to redeeming one code per offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redeemable by customers within your app if they’re using a device running iOS 14, iPadOS 14, or macOS 15, or later and your app supports the appropriate StoreKit method. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/supporting_subscription_offer_codes_in_your_app">Learn more</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideal for large campaigns that require mass distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An expiration date isn't required for custom codes. You can optionally set a maximum redemption limit and/or expiration date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each app can have up to 1 million codes per quarter, shared across all subscriptions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Customer eligibility is determined by you in App Store Connect and can include customers with new, active, and expired subscriptions. Consider your offer’s eligibility requirements before creating and distributing offer codes.</p>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Choose whether you'd like the subscription to automatically renew to the standard price upon conclusion of the offer period. (Checking the box will prevent auto-renewal, ensuring customers receive a commitment-free trial subscription. If you choose this option, you’ll only be able to choose Free offers).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the customer eligibility for your offer. You can select one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>New subscribers:</b> Customers who have never subscribed to any subscription product within the group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Existing subscribers:</b> Customers who are currently subscribed to a product within the group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Expired subscribers:</b> Customers who were previously subscribed to a product within the group, but whose subscription has expired.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your subscription has an introductory offer, determine whether people redeeming your codes should be eligible to redeem both a code and the introductory offer by choosing from the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Yes.</b> Eligible customers will redeem your app’s introductory offer first, then automatically renew to the offer they redeemed with the code. (If you've disabled auto-renewal, you won’t be able to choose this option).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>No.</b> Eligible customers will redeem the offer code first, then automatically renew to the standard subscription price without using the introductory offer. If they cancel and resubscribe at any point, they’re still eligible to redeem an introductory offer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the countries or regions where you want to make your offer available, then click Next.</p>

<p>Choose <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/pricing-and-availability/in-app-purchase-and-subscriptions-pricing-and-availability">Pay as you go, Pay up front, or Free</a>. (If you've opted to disable auto-renewal, you'll only have the option to make your offer free.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the appropriate duration, and if applicable, the discounted price for a base country or region, then click Next. To search from a larger list of price points,click See Additional Prices.</p>
<p>App Store Connect provides comparable prices for all 175 App Store countries and regions, taking into account taxes and foreign exchange rates. If you want to set different prices for specific storefronts, make the changes and click Next.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Give codes to customers directly:</b> Codes can be shared through online or offline channels. For example, you might print the codes on cards that you give out at an event. People can redeem one-time use codes by entering them in the “Redeem Gift Card or Code” page in their App Store account settings, or redeem custom codes within your app if you’ve implemented the appropriate StoreKit method. <a href="/app-store/subscriptions/#offer-codes">Learn more</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Create a unique redemption URL:</b> Codes can be used to create redemption URLs that you can share directly. When someone visits the URL, they'll land on a page where they can redeem your code. People who haven't installed your app will first be prompted to download the app before redeeming the code.</p>
<p>To create these URLs for one-time use codes, copy the example link from your offer details page, then add each code to the end of the URL. One-time use code URLs are also included in the downloadable text file.</p>
