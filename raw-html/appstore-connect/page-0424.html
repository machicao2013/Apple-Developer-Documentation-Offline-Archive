<p>Retention rate</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Retention measures the usage of your app over time starting from the first installation or re-download on the App Store.</p>
<p>Daily Retention = Active Devices on day X of the retention period/Active Devices during the entire retention period.</p>
<p>For example, if your app was first downloaded by customers on 100 devices on May 1, and seven days later (on May 8) 20 devices are still active with at least one session, the retention rate on May 8 is 20% (or 20 active devices out of 100).</p>

<td>
<p>Conversion rate</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Calculated by dividing the number of downloads and pre-orders on the App Store by unique device impressions. When a user pre-orders an app, it counts toward your conversion rate. It's not counted again when it downloads to their device.</p>
<p>For example, if your app is viewed on the App Store on 100 devices, and 50 users download it, and 20 users pre-order it, your conversion rate for the selected period would be 70%.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Product page conversion rate</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The number of downloads and pre-orders that came from your app’s App Store product page divided by unique product page views. When a user pre-orders an app, it counts toward your conversion rate. It's not counted again when it downloads to their device. number of First-Time Downloads, Redownloads, and Pre-Orders that came from your app’s product page by Unique Product Page Views. Pre-Orders are counted on the day the pre-order is initiated and, to avoid double counting, the subsequent download is excluded.</p>
<p>For example, if your product page is viewed on 100 devices, and 50 users download the app, and 20 users pre-order it, your conversion rate for the selected period would be 70%.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Sales per paying user</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Your app’s total sales (including associated In-App Purchases) / your app’s total number of paying users on the App Store for the selected period.</p>
<p>For example, if your app’s total sales for the period is $100, and your app has 100 paying users, your sales per paying user is $1.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Sessions per active device</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The number of times your app was opened by an App Store customer for at least two seconds / the number of active devices for your app in the selected period.</p>
<p>For example, if your app was opened 100 times, and you have 10 active devices for the same period, then your Sessions Per Active Device ratio is 10.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Proceeds per paying user</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The estimated amount you'll receive for sales of your apps or In-App Purchases / your app’s total number of paying users on the App Store for the selected period.</p>
<p>For example, if your app’s total proceeds for the period are $100, and your app has 100 paying users, your proceeds per paying user are $1.</p>

<p>Crash rate</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>A metric available for <a href="/help/app-store-connect/view-app-analytics/view-peer-group-benchmarks">peer group benchmarks</a> that shows the number of crashes per session for the selected period.</p>
<p>For example, if your app had 10 crashes and 100 sessions for the selected period, the crash rate is 10%.</p>
