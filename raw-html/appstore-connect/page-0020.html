<h1>Overview of Game Center</h1>
<p>Game Center is Apple’s social gaming network that lets players track their progress, invite friends to play, start multiplayer games through auto-match, and more. It also boosts the discovery of your games across players’ devices. Once you’ve implemented Game Center features, you’re ready to enter related metadata in App Store Connect.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>To add a game with Game Center features to a new app bundle, the game must be “Ready for Distribution" on at least one App Store storefront. For games distributed through <a href="/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu">alternative distribution</a>, availability on at least one App Store storefront is required to utilize Game Center functionality.</p>

<p><b>Implement Game Center features.</b></p>
<p>To integrate Game Center into your app using Xcode, add the necessary code and configure the service's components. Although these components are set up independently from your app bundle, they must be closely integrated with your game's code to fulfill all design and development requirements. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit">Learn more.</a></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Test your game.</b></p>
<p>Ensure that your Game Center components work individually and together. Apple enables all prerelease development to take place in the same server environment as released games, so you can play with the full player base, not just other testers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Distribute your game.</b></p>
<p>Add your Game Center components to your desired platform version before submitting your game for review.</p>
