<h1>Overview of product page optimization</h1>
<p>Optimize your iOS or iPadOS app's product page on the App Store by testing up to three different app icons, screenshots, and previews to see which resonate best with customers. Each variant will be randomly shown to a user group you define, and can be localized in any language your app supports. Use App Analytics to evaluate performance and feature the top-performing assets to all users.</p>
<p>The methodology for determining the treatment that’s best at driving app engagement is based on the estimated lift in conversion rate, as well as algorithms that provide confidence in the reliability of the test results. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/view-app-analytics/view-product-page-optimization-results">Learn how to view product page optimization results.</a></p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>Your app must be in the Ready for Distribution state to test its product page. Releasing a new app version while a test is in progress may impact the results if your version contains assets or metadata that are currently being tested. Product page optimization tests aren't available for custom product pages or for product pages on the App Store for Apple Watch or iMessage.</p>
<p>Treatments are shown to users on the App Store on iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, or later.</p>
