<p>If you submit a routing app to App Review, Apple doesn’t start the review process until you upload a geographic coverage file. You can upload the geographic coverage file when you first create the app record or later after you upload a build.</p>
<p>For the complete steps to configure a routing app, an app that provides point-to-point directions for other apps, visit <a href="https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev3fe77deca" target="_blank"><i>Configure a routing app (iOS, watchOS)</i></a> in Xcode Help.</p>
