<h1>Apple-hosted asset pack statuses</h1>
<p>The <em>asset pack</em> status tells you immediately whether your asset pack version needs attention. The status applies only to the version of an asset pack, not the entire app or asset pack.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A red status indicator (<img alt="" class="help-app-status help-app-status-small no-margin-right" src="/help/images/icons/status-red-icon_2x.png"/>) means that you need to perform some action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A yellow status indicator (<img alt="" class="help-app-status help-app-status-small no-margin-right" src="/help/images/icons/status-yellow-icon_2x.png"/>) means that some process is ongoing, controlled either by you or by Apple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A green status indicator (<img alt="" class="help-app-status help-app-status-small no-margin-right" src="/help/images/icons/status-green-icon_2x.png"/>) means the asset pack is ready to be tested in TestFlight or live on the App Store.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're using Transporter, iTMSTransporter, or altool, new asset pack versions are automatically created when you upload an asset pack, so the Processing status will likely display instead.
