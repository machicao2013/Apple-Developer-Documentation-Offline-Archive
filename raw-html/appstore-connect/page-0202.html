<h1>Submit Apple-hosted asset packs</h1>
<p>Asset packs must be reviewed before they can be tested externally in TestFlight or made available for users on the App Store. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/test-apple-hosted-asset-packs">Learn about submitting asset packs for external testing.</a></p>
<p>Once an asset pack version is approved for the App Store, it’ll automatically be available to all App Store users, and any previous versions of the asset pack will be replaced with the new one.</p>
<p>If you want to submit an asset pack and your app hasn’t been approved yet, include the asset pack in the same submission as your first app version. If your app is already approved, you can choose to submit an asset pack with or without an app version. You can also add other items to a submission.</p>
<p>You can include up to ten different asset packs in a submission, with one version of each asset pack permitted at a time.</p>

The asset pack version, and any other items in your submission, will be reviewed together with the latest version of the selected platform.</p>
<p>You may choose to add other items to the submission.</p>
