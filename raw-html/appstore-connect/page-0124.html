<h3>Determine your export compliance requirements</h3>
<div>
<p>App Store Connect provides a set of questions to help you determine whether app encryption documentation is required from you, and which forms are specifically needed.</p>
<p><a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/export-compliance-documentation-for-encryption">Learn about the app encryption documentation you may need to provide.</a></p>
<ol class="compound-item-list">
<li>
<p>In Apps, select the app you want to view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the sidebar, click App Information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next to App Encryption Documentation, click the add button (+) and answer the questions that appear in the dialogs.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can click Manage next to the build that’s missing app encryption information on either the Distribution tab or TestFlight tab to answer the required questions.</p>

<h3>Upload your documentation</h3>
<div>
<p>If you’re required to upload app encryption documentation, you can do so in the App Encryption Documentation section in the App Store Connect. This should be completed before submitting a build for review on either App Review or TestFlight App Review. To ensure a smooth review process, populate the App Description field and <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/manage-availability-for-your-app-on-the-app-store">manage availability for your app on the App Store</a> before providing this documentation. Without this information, Apple can’t determine whether the app encryption documents are sufficient.</p>

<div class="Task">
<p>Apple evaluates export compliance reviews on a case-by-case basis. If you provide complete information, Apple expects to review and clear apps in approximately two business days. Once your documentation is approved, Apple will provide you a key value. You must <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/complying_with_encryption_export_regulations">enter this value in Xcode</a> to avoid answering encryption questions with each app submission. You can find this key value next to your approved documentation in the App Encryption Documentation section of App Store Connect.</p>
<p>If your app doesn’t require documentation, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/complying_with_encryption_export_regulations">update your app’s information property list (Info.plist) file in Xcode</a> to let us know that your app doesn't use encryption or is exempt from providing documentation.</p>
<p>If you have specific questions about Apple's export process, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/topic/SC1110/subtopic/30067/solution/select">contact us</a>.</p>
