<p>After you upload a build to App Store Connect, it goes through app thinning, a process that creates variants of your app for different devices and operating system versions. You can view the amount of space a variant occupies on the customer’s device directly in App Store Connect.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>When your app is approved for distribution, it’s encrypted with Digital Rights Management (DRM) and recompressed. The app file size for your binary may be larger than it’s for the binary you uploaded in App Store Connect. The exact final size for your app can't be determined in advance.</p>

<p>A table appears displaying the different variant sizes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>device type</em> is the target device for the variant. <em>Universal</em> refers to the variant that runs on all supported operating systems and target devices that are delivered to customers running iOS 8 or earlier, apps purchased in volume through Apple School Manager and Apple Business Manager or through <a href="https://support.apple.com//guide/deployment/">Mobile Device Management (MDM)</a>, or apps <a href="https://support.apple.com//downloads/itunes">downloaded using iTunes 12.6</a> or earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>install size</em> is the amount of disk space the app consumes on the customer’s device. The install size also appears on your app’s product page in the Information section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>download size</em> is the compressed size of the app that’s downloaded over the air, using cellular bandwidth or Wi-Fi.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If any of the device variant sizes exceed the 200 MB over-the-air download limit, a yellow warning icon appears next to the build string in the Builds table and next to the variant size in the App File Sizes table. Click the warning icon to read the full warning. Apple also sends you an email with this information.</p>

<p>Apple calculates the minimum operating system version required for your app to run based on your build settings. You can verify a build's device requirements on the Build Metadata page.</p>

<li>
<p>The <em>Minimum macOS version</em> is the minimum version of macOS required for your app to run, as determined by Apple.</p>
<p>Apple automatically calculates the minimum macOS version using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/lsminimumsystemversion">LSMinimumSystemVersion</a> provided in your build, if applicable, and the closest related macOS for the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/minimumosversion">MinimumOSVersion</a> provided in your build.
