<h1>Manage pricing for auto-renewable subscriptions</h1>
<p>Auto-renewable subscriptions can be priced by App Store country or region (also known as storefronts.) You can choose from 800 price points in each currency, with the option for the <span class="no-glossary">Account Holder</span> to submit a request for additional higher price points.</p>
<p>After you set a starting price for your auto-renewable subscription, you can schedule one future price change at a time, per country or region. If you schedule a second price change when you already have a change scheduled, the first scheduled change will be overwritten. You also have the option to preserve prices for existing subscribers.</p>

<h3>Increase the price of an auto-renewable subscription</h3>
<div>
<p>Increases in auto-renewable subscription prices result in either a notice to active subscribers or a request for consent, based on certain criteria below. Subscribers on introductory or promotional price subscriptions, including free trials and paid offers, will renew for at least one more billing period at the price that was displayed when they subscribed, to ensure their notice or request for consent for the new price is sent at least 30 days in advance. If a subscriber doesn’t consent before the first renewal at the higher price, their subscription will expire at the end of the last billing cycle at the former price.</p>
<div class="Subhead">
<h3 class="Name">Consent needed</h3>
<p>If any of the following applies, subscribers must consent to the price increase before their next renewal date in order for the subscription to renew. * Apple will automatically contact subscribers by email or push notification to request consent.</p>
<p class="lighter smaller">* If you increase the price of an auto-renewable subscription in India, subscribers who have enabled UPI AutoPay must consent to the new price and have a sufficient payment balance associated with their Apple Account, or they’ll go into the billing retry state at the end of their current billing period. Apple will notify these subscribers as part of the price increase notice, but you may also wish to notify subscribers separately. Subscribers who don’t have a sufficient Apple Account balance or who wish to continue paying with UPI AutoPay must repurchase the subscription at the new price. <a href="https://support.apple.com//HT212781">Learn more.</a></p>
<p class="lighter smaller">* For users converting from trials or offers in South Korea, Apple will collect consent via email, in-app sheets, or push notifications. The timing and frequency of these communications may differ from those shown for standard subscription price increases. <a href="https://www.ftc.go.kr/www/selectBbsNttList.do?bordCd=3&amp;key=12&amp;searchCtgry=01,02">Learn more.</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The subscriber is located in a region that requires consent for any price changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The price increase is more than 50% of the current price and the difference in price exceeds approximately US$5 per period for non-annual subscriptions, or US$50 per year for annual subscriptions. (International equivalents for prices not in USD are based on current exchange rates with specific thresholds that are subject to change based on changes in taxes or foreign exchange rates.) <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/in-app-purchases-and-subscriptions/auto-renewable-subscription-price-increase-thresholds">View a list of thresholds per storefront.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The subscriber experienced a price increase for that subscription within the past 12 months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The timing of price consent requests from Apple depends on the length of the subscription. If a price increase occurs within the minimum required notice period (7 days for weekly subscriptions, 27 days for 1 month subscriptions, and 30 days for subscription durations longer than 1 month), subscribers will renew at their existing price for one more billing period and will be notified before the end of their next billing period.</p>

<p>If none of the criteria apply, Apple will automatically notify subscribers of the price increase with no additional request for consent.

On iOS 13.4 or later, Apple will also notify subscribers via in-app messaging.

<div>
<h3>How will changes to foreign exchange rates and tax adjustments affect auto-renewable subscription pricing?</h3>
<p>Apple will not make price adjustments on your auto-renewable subscription products. Retail price changes initiated by Apple due to tax changes and significant foreign exchange rate movements will exclude auto-renewable subscriptions. For any value-added tax (VAT) rate changes, your proceeds and Apple’s commission will be calculated after the deduction of VAT, which means that your proceeds will change. You can choose to pass any changes caused by taxation or foreign exchange onto your subscribers by adjusting the price for your subscription.</p>
