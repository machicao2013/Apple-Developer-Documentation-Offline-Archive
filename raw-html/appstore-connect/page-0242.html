<h1>Manage availability of iPhone and iPad apps on Macs with Apple silicon</h1>
<p>Users running macOS 11 or later on Macs with Apple silicon can access iPhone and iPad apps through the Mac App Store, provided no edits are made to the app availability. There's no porting process since these apps use the same frameworks, resources, and runtime environments as they do on iOS and iPadOS.</p>
<p>When an app supports <a href="/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-platforms/">universal purchase</a> and already has a presence on the Mac App Store through the macOS platform, you won’t have the option to offer the iOS app on the Mac App Store. Additionally, if your iOS app is available on the Mac App Store by using this option and you later add a macOS app by adding the macOS platform in App Store Connect, releasing it to the store will replace the iOS app on the Mac App Store. Existing users of the iOS app will be updated to the macOS app.</p>
<p>You can choose to make your iPhone and iPad apps available, or not, on the Mac App Store for users running macOS 11 or later on Macs with Apple silicon. This is set at the app level and will apply to all versions of your app.</p>
<p>Apple automatically calculates the minimum macOS version using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/lsminimumsystemversion">LSMinimumSystemVersion</a> from your build (if applicable) and the macOS version corresponding to your build's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/minimumosversion">MinimumOSVersion</a>. If you’ve selected a minimum macOS version in Pricing and Availability that's higher than either the LSMinimumSystemVersion or the macOS version corresponding to the MinimumOSVersion, the version you selected will be displayed instead.</p>
