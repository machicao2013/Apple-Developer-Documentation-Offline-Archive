<p>When testing your app's subscriptions in TestFlight, the renewal rate is accelerated. Each subscription is renewed daily, up to 6 times within a 1-week period, regardless of the subscription's duration.</p>

<p class="note"><b>Example scenario: </b>If you start a 1-month subscription on February 1st, it'll renew every 24 hours for a total of 6 renewals before being canceled. Since subscriptions renew at an accelerated rate in TestFlight, you'll see a new transaction for each renewal on February 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th. The subscription's auto-renewal will then be disabled on February 8th.</p>

<h3>Test In-App Purchase scenarios in TestFlight with your Sandbox Apple Account</h3>
<div>
<p>Apps downloaded from TestFlight will automatically operate in a sandbox environment. However, to test different In-App Purchase scenarios in TestFlight, you can use your Sandbox Apple Account. First, sign out of your production Apple Account under Media &amp; Purchases. Then, go to Developer settings and sign in with your Sandbox Apple Account to access the sandbox controls for testing. For more details, please refer to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/testing-in-app-purchases-with-sandbox"> Sign in to your Sandbox Apple Account for TestFlight</a> section.</p>
<p>To learn more about the different In-App Purchase scenarios you can test with your Sandbox Apple Account, visit the <a href="/help/app-store-connect/test-in-app-purchases/manage-sandbox-apple-account-settings">Manage Sandbox Apple Account settings</a> page.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
