<h2>Ratings and reviews on the App Store</h2>
<p>Users can rate your app on a scale from 1 to 5 stars on all platforms. Additionally, users can submit written reviews for your iOS, macOS, and visionOS apps. However, they can’t do this for tvOS apps. When a customer edits their rating or review, the most recent change will display on your App Store product page. If a user submits a new rating or review, it'll replace the previous submission.</p>
<p>Your App Store product page displays a single overview rating for your app for each country or region of the App Store as well as individual customer ratings and reviews. If enough reviews are available, the device will display a summary of these reviews on iOS 18.1 or later.</p>
<p>Your App Store product page will display a reviews summary on devices with iOS 18.4 or later, generated using large language models (LLMs). This summary presents key highlights from user reviews in a concise paragraph.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>You can tap and hold the summary to report a concern on the App Store or <a href="/help/app-store-connect/monitor-ratings-and-reviews/view-ratings-and-reviews#report-a-concern">report a concern</a> in App Store Connect.</p>
</div>
<p>iOS apps that use the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit">WatchKit</a> or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/messages">Messages</a> frameworks share the same rating across the App Store for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and iMessage.</p>
</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h2>View ratings and reviews</h2>
<p>You can view all customer ratings and reviews from the App Store directly in App Store Connect. App Store provides an <a href="/help/app-store-connect/monitor-ratings-and-reviews/view-ratings-and-reviews">overview rating</a> and review summaries for devices running iOS 18.1 or later, specific to selected countries or regions. The country or region associated with a rating reflects the location where the customer initially purchased the app. Additionally, you can view individual app reviews on the App Store.</p>
</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h2>Respond to reviews</h2>
<p>For iOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS apps on the App Store, you can <a href="/help/app-store-connect/monitor-ratings-and-reviews/respond-to-reviews">respond to customer reviews</a>. When you respond to a customer review, the customer is notified and can update their review in response. If you make multiple edits to your response in a short time, such as to correct a typo, the user receives only one notification. If the customer updates their review on the App Store, users with Admin or Customer Support roles in App Store Connect will be notified, provided they have access and relevant <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/view-and-edit-your-profile#set-email-notifications">notifications turned on</a>.</p>
<p>Your response remains publicly visible on your App Store product page, even if the customer edits their review. You can <a href="/help/app-store-connect/monitor-ratings-and-reviews/respond-to-reviews">edit or delete your response</a> at any time. Only one response per review will be displayed on the product page.</p>
<p>All ratings, reviews, and responses are publicly available on your App Store product page. Ensure your responses are appropriate for a public audience. If you find a review offensive or inappropriate, <a href="/help/app-store-connect/monitor-ratings-and-reviews/view-ratings-and-reviews#report-a-concern">report a concern</a>.</p>

<div class="Subhead">
<h2>Reset app rating</h2>
<p>You can <a href="/help/app-store-connect/monitor-ratings-and-reviews/reset-an-app-overview-rating">reset your app’s rating</a> when you release a new version on the App Store. A message will appear on your product page indicating that the overview rating was recently reset. This message remains until sufficient users have rated the new version, at which point a new overview rating will be displayed.</p>
