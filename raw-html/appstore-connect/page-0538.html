<h1>View In-App Event metrics</h1>
<p>App Analytics provides insights into how In-App Events impact your app's acquisition, user engagement, and monetization. With App Analytics, you can understand key performance metrics, such as how many users are discovering your In-App Events on the App Store and Apple Games, how successful your In-App Events are at getting users to download your app, as well as how engaged users remain with your app over time.</p>
<p>When a user discovers your In-App Event on the App Store and Apple Games, an Event Impression is counted. If the user already has your app installed and clicks a link from the event to your app, this action counts as an App Open. Users can also opt to receive a reminder just before the event starts. App Analytics counts how many times users tap on those notifications bringing them to your In-App Events.</p>
