<h1>Set distribution methods</h1>
<p>In App Store Connect, you can choose between two distribution options for your app:</p>
<p><b>Public Distribution:</b> Your app will be publicly available on the App Store in the <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/manage-availability-for-your-app-on-the-app-store">selected countries or regions</a>. It can also be available to anyone for volume purchase through Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager. You can request to <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/set-distribution-methods#make-your-app-available-only-through-a-direct-link">change your publicly available app to an unlisted app</a> to make your app discoverable on the App Store only with a direct link.  <a href="/support/unlisted-app-distribution">Learn about unlisted app distribution.</a></p>
<p><b>Private Distribution:</b> Your app will be available only on Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager to specific businesses and organizations that you specify in App Store Connect.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>Once your app is approved, the distribution method can't be changed. However, you can <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/set-distribution-methods#make-your-app-available-only-through-a-direct-link">change a publicly available app to an unlisted app</a>. To switch from private to public distribution—or vice versa—you must create a new app record and resubmit your binary.</p>

<p>If you don’t want individual users to be able to download your app from the App Store, you can restrict the availability of your app to only specific businesses or organizations. This includes the ability to distribute proprietary apps for internal use within your organization.</p>
<p>You can specify one or more organizations that can view and download the app in Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager. They can then distribute it through Mobile Device Management or redemption codes.</p>

<p>Apps that aren’t suited for public distribution can be made discoverable as unlisted on the App Store with a direct link. Unlisted apps don’t show in any categories, recommendations, charts, search results, or other listings in the App Store. You can also use this direct link within Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager.</p>

<p>In the sidebar, click Pricing and Availability.</p>

<li>
<p>Under App Distribution methods, make sure your app’s availability is set to Public. If your app has been approved for private download on Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager, you must create a new app record in App Store Connect, upload your binary, and set the distribution method to Public before proceeding to the next step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit your app for review, if you haven’t already.</p>

<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>Once your app is approved, the distribution method can't be changed.

<p>To receive an unlisted link, <a href="/support/unlisted-app-distribution">submit a request</a>. Upon approval, your app's distribution method will change to Unlisted in the Pricing and Availability section of the app information page. Future versions of your app will remain unlisted.</p>

<h3>I currently have an app that is available privately in Apple Business Manager and I’d like to make it available publicly on the App Store, can I change my app’s distribution method?</h3>
<p>No. Changing your app's distribution method from public to private, or vice versa, requires submitting a new app for review.</p>
<h3>Where can users download my app in volume?</h3>
<p>Downloading apps in volume requires either an Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager account. Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager are available in many <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT207305">countries and regions</a>.</p>
