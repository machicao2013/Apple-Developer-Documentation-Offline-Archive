<h1>Manage an app version for Game Center</h1>
<p>Apps offering Game Center features need to include <a href="/help/account/reference/capability-entitlement-updates/">the Game Center entitlement in the entitlements plist</a> and have Game Center features configured in App Store Connect before they can be <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/overview-of-submitting-for-review">submitted for review</a>.</p>
<p>You can enable or disable Game Center for your app at the version level. Once an app version is approved with Game Center enabled, Game Center can’t be disabled for that version. Instead, you’ll need to disable Game Center when submitting an updated app version.</p>

<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>Games distributed on <a href="/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu">alternative app marketplaces</a> will need to also be available on at least one App Store storefront to take advantage of Game Center functionality.</p>
