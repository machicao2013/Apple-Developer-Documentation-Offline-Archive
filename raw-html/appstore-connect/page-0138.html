<h1>Set a tax category</h1>
<p>Apple's tax calculation service uses multiple inputs to compute tax on customer transactions in countries or regions where taxes are <span class="no-glossary">administered</span>. These inputs include your tax category selection in App Store Connect, app metadata, legal entity status, tax registration status, customer attributes, and other requirements in accordance with local laws and regulations.</p>
<p>You need to choose the category that most accurately describes each app. By default, this category applies to In-App Purchases. However, you also have the option to <a href="/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/set-a-tax-category-for-in-app-purchases">set a specific category for each In-App Purchase</a>. If you modify any tax category settings, it will only impact future transactions.</p>
<p>If you choose not to make any changes, your apps and In-App Purchases will be assigned the App Store software category. You can adjust these settings at any time as the characterization of your app or In-App Purchases change or as tax legislation changes. Ensure that the tax category settings you choose accurately represent your app's offerings. Selecting categories or attributes that aren't appropriate for your app or In-App Purchases violates your obligations under the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, the Paid Agreements, and local tax laws.</p>
<p>Your tax category selections may result in changes to your proceeds, as proceeds are calculated based on the price of your app or In-App Purchase, minus any applicable taxes. To view your estimated proceeds at each price tier, click All Prices and Currencies from Pricing and Availability.</p>
