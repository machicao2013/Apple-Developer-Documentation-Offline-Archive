<h1>Reporting tokens and transactions to Apple</h1>
<p class="spacing-bottom">In certain regions, if your apps or digital goods and services are offered outside of the App Store, your app or website receives a token when a customer initiates an external purchase. You’ll need to send a monthly report to Apple that includes all transactions associated with these tokens for applicable commission and fee calculation and collection purposes.</p>
<div class="Subhead">
<h3>When is it required</h3>
<p>Any time you use alternative payment options in your App Store app or sell digital goods and services in your alternatively distributed app, you must submit a monthly report within 15 days after the end of the calendar month. Learn more about using the <a href="/documentation/ExternalPurchaseServerAPI">External Purchase Server API</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/marketplacekit">MarketplaceKit</a>. </p>
