<h1>Create and submit app bundles</h1>
<p>You can offer apps, including those part of a universal purchase, as an app bundle on the App Store. App bundles simplify the process for you, letting you group up to ten of your apps together in a single download.</p>
<p>Apps in a bundle must follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All apps must be either all paid or all free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A paid app bundle can only include paid apps and must be offered at a reduced price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must ensure that each app in a free app bundle is free and offers an auto-renewable subscription. The subscription must allow the user to subscribe to and access content or services in all apps included in the bundle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Customers purchase the bundle with a single tap or click, and the individual apps install automatically on their device. Customers who have previously bought one or more apps in an app bundle can use the Complete My Bundle feature. The bundle price adjusts to reflect their existing purchases.</p>

<p>All apps in a bundle must support the same platform as the first app you add, known as the <em>primary app</em>.</p>
<p>If the primary app supports multiple platforms, you can add an app that supports all of the same platforms or more, an app that supports only one of the platforms or any combination of these apps. However, if you add an app that supports only one of the shared platforms, all subsequent apps must also support that platform. Additionally, apps that support tvOS only can’t be part of a bundle.</p>
