<h1>Manage app tags</h1>
<p>App tags are glanceable terms that help people understand more about your app or game’s essential qualities. In addition to appearing in App Store search results, app tags can now appear on your product page, further improving the discoverability of your apps and games on the App Store. From these placements, people can tap a specific tag - for example, Sleep - to view more apps and games related to that specific tag. Tags are based on the App Store metadata you provide in App Store Connect, artificial intelligence, and human curation. You can also manage which of your selected tags appear across the App Store in the app information section of App Store Connect.</p>
<p>App Tags allow you to:</p>
<ul class="compound-item-list">
<li>
<p>Increase discoverability: Tags appear as glanceable terms in search results and as clickable entities on Search Landing Page and Product Page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect with the right audience: Tags align your app with user intent, leading to improved relevance.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can manage tags in App Store Connect to ensure they are relevant to your app’s functionality. Currently, tags are only supported and displayed to users across the App Store in the United States. </p>
