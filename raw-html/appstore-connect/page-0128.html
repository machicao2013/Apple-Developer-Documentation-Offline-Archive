<h1>Manage app privacy</h1>
<p>You’re required to provide a privacy policy URL for your iOS app platform and privacy policy text for your tvOS app platform. Offering a privacy choices URL is optional. Furthermore, if you're distributing your app on the App Store, you're required to explain your data handling practices in App Store Connect. This informs users about the data that may be collected through your app and how it may be used.
	</p>
<p>Your responses to the app privacy questions are used to help inform customers about your app’s data practices. Based on the information you submit, your App Store product page will be updated to include details about the app's data collection and usage.</p>
<p>Responses are provided at the app level and should accurately represent your app's data practices across all platforms. You should answer in the most comprehensive and inclusive way if your app collects more data on one platform than another. You must include information about your app's privacy practices and those of third-party partners whose code you integrate into your app.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>You’re responsible for keeping your responses accurate and up to date. If your practices change, update your responses in App Store Connect.</p>
