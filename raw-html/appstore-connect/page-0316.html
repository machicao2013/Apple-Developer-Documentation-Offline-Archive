<h1>App bundle information</h1>
<p><em>App bundle information</em> refers to the set of properties required to create an app bundle. Certain information pertains specifically to the app bundle, App Store Connect derives some from the first app you add to the bundle (the primary app), and other information comes from all the apps in the bundle.</p>
<div class="Subhead margin-top">
<h2>Bundle-specific information</h2>
<p>This information is required for the primary language of the app bundle. Additional localizations are optional.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper">

<p>This is optional. This can be the same URL as you use for the individual apps or a different one.</p>

<td colspan="4">
<p>Price</p>
</td>
<td colspan="8">
<p>The level that determines both the customer price and your proceeds.</p>
<p>The price tiers are broken down to Compatible Price Tiers and Incompatible Price Tiers. Compatible Price Tiers represent the price tiers that have met the minimum and maximum bundle pricing rules listed in App Bundle Availability and Price. Selecting one of these tiers can ensure that your app bundle can be made available on the App Store as long as all other requirements have been met.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that future price changes and intervals that have been set for your app could affect the list of compatible price tiers.</p>

<tr>
<td colspan="4">
<p>SKU</p>
</td>
<td colspan="8">
<p>A unique ID for your bundle. The bundle SKU must be different from that of the SKU of the individual apps. You can use letters, numbers, hyphens, periods, and underscore. The SKU can't start with a hyphen, period, or underscore.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="4">
<p>Cleared for Sale</p>
</td>
<td colspan="8">
<p>Select Cleared for Sale to make your app bundle available on the App Store. There are no bundle-specific country or region settings. An app bundle will be live on the App Store only where all the member apps are available.</p>
<p>For example, if some of the apps in the bundle are cleared for sale worldwide but some are live only in specific countries or regions, the bundle will be available only in those countries or regions. You won't be able to select the Cleared for Sale checkbox if you already have ten app bundles cleared for sale. If you wish to clear a new app bundle for sale, you must first remove the Cleared for Sale check box from a different live bundle.</p>
