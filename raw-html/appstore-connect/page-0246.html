<h1>Publish for pre-order</h1>
<p>Before releasing your app on the App Store in a new country or region, you can choose to make it available for pre-order. This allows customers to view your product page and order the app before it's released for download.</p>
<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<p>You can offer your app for pre-order in any country or region on the App Store where the app hasn't yet been released. Both free and paid apps across all Apple platforms are eligible for pre-orders. In-App Purchases aren’t eligible for pre-order, but you can <a href="/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/overview-for-configuring-in-app-purchases">set up your In-App Purchases</a>, including promotional metadata, in App Store Connect before and during the pre-order period so that everything is ready once your app is released for download. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/promote-in-app-purchases">Promoted In-App Purchases</a> don’t display on your App Store product page until your app is released for download.</p>
<p>App bundles aren’t eligible for pre-order. An app offered for pre-order must have at least one country or region where it’s already Ready for Sale to be included in a new app bundle.</p>
<h3>Customer experience</h3>
<p>Customers can start pre-orders on devices running iOS 11.2, iPadOS 13, macOS 10.13.2, tvOS 11.2, and watchOS 6, or later. Users with earlier operating systems can access product pages through direct links but will find the Buy button disabled, prompting them to update their OS to proceed with pre-orders.</p>
<p>Customers can cancel their pre-orders in their App Store settings on iOS and macOS, and on a Windows PC. <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT202723">Learn more.</a>
<p>If your pre-order’s release date is less than 180 days from the current date, the full release date appears on your app’s product page (for example, “Expected Jan 1, 2024”). For release dates more than 180 days away, only the month and year are displayed (for example, “Expected Jan 2024”).</p>
<p>Customers who pre-order a paid app won't be charged until the app's official download release date. You may adjust the app's price during the pre-order phase; however, any price changes will result in customers being charged the lower amount—either the pre-order price they accepted or the price on the release date. Adjustments are subject to the original accepted terms.</p>
<p>Once your app is released, customers receive a notification, and the app automatically downloads to the device used for pre-ordering. It’ll also download on their eligible devices if they <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT202180">turn on automatic downloads</a>.</p>
