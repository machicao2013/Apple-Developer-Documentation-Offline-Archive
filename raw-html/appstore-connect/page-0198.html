<p>Before publishing your In-App Event on the App Store, submit your event details and media for review, ensuring all required information is complete. If you want to submit an In-App Event and your app hasn’t been approved yet, include the In-App Event in the same submission as your first iOS app version. If your app is already approved, you can choose to submit an In-App Event with or without an iOS app version. You can also add other items to a submission.</p>
<p>You can publish up to 10 In-App Events on the App Store and Apple Games at a time. Additionally, you can have up to 15 approved In-App Events per app in App Store Connect at a time.</p>
