<h1>Edit app bundle information</h1>
<p>You can edit which apps belong to your app bundle only until App Review approves it. If you have submitted your app bundle to App Review and it‘s still pending approval, you can <a href="/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/create-and-submit-app-bundles">remove it from review</a> to make changes.</p>
<p>You can make the following changes without needing additional review:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rearrange the apps in the bundle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit the bundle description and marketing URL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the primary language of the bundle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjust the pricing and availability of the bundle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an automatically generated app bundle icon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove custom app bundle icon</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your app bundle requires another review if you make the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add localizations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change an existing app bundle name or a custom app bundle icon</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To change a property of derived metadata, <a href="/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/view-and-edit-app-information">edit the app information</a> for the primary app. The app bundle metadata updates automatically when you make changes to the app's information. Alternatively, you can choose a different primary app for the app bundle.</p>

<h3>Remove a custom app bundle icon</h3>
<div>
<p>The ability to upload a bundle icon has been deprecated. If your app bundle is using a custom app bundle icon, you can delete it at any time. Your bundle reverts back and App Store Connect automatically generates an icon that displays for the first four apps in your bundle.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>Once the custom icon has been removed, you can only use the default icon going forward.</p>

<h2>Set availability for an app bundle</h2>
<p>After submitting an app bundle for App Review, and it’s been approved, it’ll automatically become available for sale when all apps within the bundle are available and all other requirements are met.</p>
<p>For an app bundle to be available, it must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul class="spacing-top-paragraph">
<li>
<p>All apps in the bundle must be either all paid or all free. A paid app bundle can only include paid apps and must be offered at a reduced price. Each app in a free app bundle must be free and offer at least one auto-renewable subscription.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paid app bundles must be sold at a reduced price, which is a price tier lower than the sum of the individual app prices in the bundle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A paid app bundle’s price must not be lower than the highest app price in the bundle. If an app in the bundle goes to a price that’s higher than the price of the bundle, the bundle will automatically be removed from the store.
					</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no bundle-specific country or region settings. An app bundle will be live only where all member apps have common countries or regions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only ten bundles can be marked as cleared for sale at any given time per developer account. If you have ten bundles marked as cleared for sale, you can create additional bundles, but you can’t select Cleared for Sale option for an additional bundle unless you first unselect it from another bundle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A single app can be in no more than three cleared-for-sale bundles at one time.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>While an app bundle can have the status Ready for Sale, it might not be available on the App Store. You can check its availability from the app bundle page.</p>
<ol class="compound-item-list">
<li>
<p>In Apps, select the app bundle you want to view.</p>
<p>If the app bundle isn’t available, a warning message appears at the top of the page. The message states the reasons that the app bundle isn’t available, such as incompatible pricing.</p>
