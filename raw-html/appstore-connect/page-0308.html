<h1>Role permissions</h1>
<p>The tasks you're able to perform depends on your user role. The Account Holder can access all aspects of App Store Connect and the Apple Developer website, and is the only user that can sign legal agreements, renew membership, request access to the App Store Connect API, remove auto-renewable subscriptions from sale, submit Safari Extensions, or create developer ID certificates.</p>
<p>Members of an organization’s team in the Apple Developer Program also have access to membership resources on the Apple Developer website and other membership benefits. Users who have been given access to App Store Connect by an individual enrolled in the Apple Developer Program only have access to App Store Connect.</p>
