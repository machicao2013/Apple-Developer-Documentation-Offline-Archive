<h1>Set up introductory offers for auto-renewable subscriptions</h1>
<p>You can set up introductory offers for your apps on the App Store that contain auto-renewable subscriptions in App Store Connect. An introductory offer is a limited-time discounted price or free trial for the initial period of a subscription.</p>
<p>When you set up an introductory offer, it automatically appears on your app’s product page on the App Store for eligible users. You can also display introductory offers within your app. When displaying offers in your app, use receipt validation to ensure that you’re only showing offers to people who can redeem them. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/original_api_for_in-app_purchase/subscriptions_and_offers/implementing_introductory_offers_in_your_app">Learn about implementing introductory offers</a>.</p>
<p>There are three types of introductory offers: free trial, pay up front, and pay as you go. You can choose the length of the introductory offer based on the standard subscription duration.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between introductory offer limits and customer eligibility limits?</h3>
<p>App Store Connect allows you to set an introductory offer for each subscription product in App Store Connect. You can have multiple offers in each subscription group. New and returning customers are only eligible to use one introductory offer per subscription group. For example, if a customer uses a free trial and then upgrades to a subscription product in the same group that also has a free trial, they aren't eligible for the second offer.</p>
