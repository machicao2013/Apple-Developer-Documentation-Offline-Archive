<p>In-App Events, such as game competitions, movie premieres, and live-streamed experiences, are timely events within apps and games. Customers can discover these events on the App Store and Apple Games for iOS and iPadOS, providing a new way to showcase and expand their reach.</p>
<p>On iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 and later, In-App Events appear across the App Store as event cards that include images or video, the event name, and a short description. Customers can tap to open an event details page, which provides a more immersive experience with a longer event description. It also includes information about any required In-App Purchases or subscriptions. Customers can opt in on the event card and event details page to receive a notification from the App Store when your event starts.</p>
