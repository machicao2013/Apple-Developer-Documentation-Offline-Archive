<h1>Turn on Family Sharing for In-App Purchases</h1>
<p>Family Sharing is a feature supported only by apps that offer <a href="/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/overview-for-configuring-in-app-purchases">auto-renewable subscriptions and non-consumable In-App Purchases</a>. This feature enables users to share their purchases with up to five additional family members. To configure which of your In-App Purchases are eligible for Family Sharing, navigate to App Store Connect.</p>
<p>Whether or not a user’s purchases are automatically shared with their family members depends on the type of In-App Purchase, the user’s sharing preferences, and if the purchase was made before or after Family Sharing was turned on in App Store Connect. Users have the option of turning off Family Sharing in their subscription settings at any time.</p>
