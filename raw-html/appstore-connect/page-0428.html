<td>
<p>Product page</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>A page on the App Store that informs people about your app and lets them download it onto their device.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Test</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>An experiment in which different treatments of your product page are shown to a percentage of users so their performance can be compared to the performance of your original product page during the same timeframe.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Variant</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>An instance of your product page (either the original or a treatment).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Treatment</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>A variant of your product page that’s compared to your original product page.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Original</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Your default product page, which serves as the control for your test.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Referral traffic</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Visits to any variant of your product page from a direct URL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Apply treatment</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The action of replacing the metadata on your original product page with the metadata from one of your treatments.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Confidence level</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The probability that the data gathered in a test suggests that two variants are performing differently.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Baseline</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The variant that the other pages are being compared against.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Collecting data</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Data is still being collected to determine whether this variant is performing better than the baseline.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Performing better</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This variant is performing better than the baseline with at least 90% confidence.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Performing worse</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This variant is performing worse than the baseline with at least 90% confidence.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Likely to be inconclusive</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Based on the current results, there likely won’t be enough data after 90 days to determine how this variant is performing compared to the baseline.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Estimated conversion rate</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The estimated percentage of people that downloaded or pre-ordered your app from a certain product page variant. This estimate incorporates the data observed during the test, as well as existing data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Estimated relative lift</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The estimated relative increase in conversion rate for a variant as compared to the selected baseline. It requires fewer weeks of data to determine significance on higher improvement values (e.g. 30%) as opposed to lower improvement values (e.g. 5%). Your actual test duration will depend on the level of improvement detected during your specific test.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Bayesian reasoning</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>A statistical method where probability expresses a degree of confidence in an event; used to justify confidence in your conversion rate lift.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Credible interval</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The probable range of your lift or conversion rate. This represents a 90% interval, meaning there’s a 90% probability that the conversion rate or lift falls within this range.</p>
</td>
