<h1>View tester feedback</h1>
<p>Feedback submitted by testers running TestFlight 2.3 or later appears in App Store Connect. This feedback includes screenshots, comments related to crashes, and general comments. It’s also available in TestFlight for Mac and Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>Testers running iOS 14 or iPadOS 14 or later can submit feedback on the App Clip experience.</p>
<p>Testers running TestFlight 2.2.1 or earlier on iOS 12.4 or earlier can send feedback to the email address you specify in the Feedback Email field in Test Information.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>When a tester is invited by an invitation email, their email address is displayed in the detailed feedback view. If a tester is invited using a public link, they appear as anonymous unless they enter their email address when submitting feedback. In such cases, the email address is only displayed for that specific piece of feedback. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/testflight/beta-tester-feedback">Learn more about the detailed feedback view.</a> </p>
