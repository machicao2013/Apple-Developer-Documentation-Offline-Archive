<h1>Estimate fees for alternative business terms</h1>
<p>Apple offers an Alternative Terms Addendum for developers distributing apps in the European Union (EU), which allows them to distribute apps outside the App Store. For developers who want nothing to change for them — from how the App Store works currently and in the rest of the world — no action is needed, and they can continue to distribute their apps only on the App Store and use its private and secure In-App Purchase system. For those who adopt the new terms, the fees you may owe to Apple may change. Access the available data to help you determine how these terms may apply to your business if you choose to adopt them, including new App Install reports, and the Sales and Trends dashboard.</p>
<p>This information is provided for estimation purposes only.</p>
<p>To understand potential fees if you choose the new business terms, you can use your app’s historical performance to estimate future fees. You'll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number of first annual installs your app generated in a 12 month period, which is available in the Historical App Install Reports in Sales and Trends. Fees won’t be charged against installs in these reports.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>App Clip installs and installs from Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager aren't included in these reports, but will be measured and counted if you agree to the new business terms.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>If you offer In-App Purchases:</i> Your app’s previous sales from iPhone and iPad devices in the EU, available in the Sales and Trends dashboard.</p>
</li>

<h3>Calculating the monthly fee</h3>
<div>
<p>The Core Technology Fee is calculated by looking at the number of first annual installs in the past 12 months. On a monthly basis, developers are only billed for one-twelfth of the Core Technology Fee for each first annual install in excess of one million. If an app has fewer than one million first annual installs, there's no Core Technology Fee for that app that month.</p>
<p>For example, let’s look at the Forest Explorer app for the month of August. Apple looks back 12 months and considers the five months. In this case, the Forest Explorer app has generated 1.05 million first annual installs through the current month. In August, Apple only charges one-twelfth of the Core Technology Fee owed for the 50,000 first annual installs over one million, resulting in an amount of €2,083.33 due for that month. The developer will receive an invoice for the month of August presenting the monthly fee.</p>

<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b></p>
<p>In many cases, developers who exceed one million first annual installs do not pay the CTF, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Non-profit organizations, governments and education institutions with an Apple Developer Program fee waiver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-commercial developers with a no revenue business offering a free app without any monetization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small developers (earning less than €10 million global business revenue) that have not previously exceeded one million first annual installs receive a 3-year free on-ramp to the CTF.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn more about these conditions under the <a href="/help/app-store-connect/understanding-the-core-technology-fee/core-technology-fee-overview#how-the-fee-works">"How the fee works"</a> section to help you put these business terms into context with your own performance.</p>

</sf-symbol> FAQs</h3>
<div>
<h3 class="Name">I’m seeing two report versions when I download my Historical App Install reports. Which one should I use?</h3>
<p>Report version 1_1 will include first annual install data from both iOS and iPadOS, whereas report version 1_0 only includes data from iOS. We recommend using report version 1_1 in order to understand how installs across iOS and iPadOS may impact the fees you owe.</p>
<h3 class="Name">Why do the Historical App Install reports contain data for some of my apps, but not all of my apps?</h3>
<p>Apps must have received at least one install from an Apple account in the EU on iOS or iPadOS in 2023 in order to appear in the Historical App Install reports.</p>
<h3 class="Name">When I try to download the Historical App Install reports, there’s a message that says “Your apps did not generate any data for this report in the selected reporting period.” What does this mean?</h3>
<p>If none of your apps generated any installs in the EU on iOS or iPadOS in 2023, you’ll receive this message when you try to download your Historical App Install reports.</p>
<h3 class="Name">My app launched this year, but I’m seeing reinstalls and updates appear as first annual installs in my reports. Why is this happening?</h3>
<p>In some cases, users may first install your app in regions outside the EU or on devices other than iPhone before downloading your app on iOS in the EU. Since first annual installs can only occur on iOS in the EU and these users may have already installed your app outside iOS or the EU, these first annual installs may appear as reinstalls or updates.</p>
