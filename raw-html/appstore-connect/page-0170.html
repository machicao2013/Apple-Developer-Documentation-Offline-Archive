<h3>Create and submit nominations</h3>
<p>If you'd like your app to be considered for App Store featuring, submit a new nomination with details about your app. You can submit nominations individually through App Store Connect or upload multiple nominations using a CSV file.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>In App Store Connect, individual nominations are initially saved as drafts and can be edited before submission. In contrast, nominations imported through CSV are submitted automatically and can’t be saved as drafts. You can edit these nominations after submission.</p>
