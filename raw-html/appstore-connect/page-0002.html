<h1>Add multiplayer compatibility</h1>
<p>The Multiplayer Compatibility section of App Store Connect allows you to describe which versions of your Game Center-enabled apps can interact with each other during the matchmaking process. You can define the earliest multiplayer-compatible app version for iOS, macOS, and tvOS, and can even match games with different bundle identifiers against each other.</p>
