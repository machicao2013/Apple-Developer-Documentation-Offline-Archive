<p>When you release a new version of your app on the App Store, you have the option to reset its overview rating. After resetting, a message will appear on your App Store product page indicating that the rating was recently reset. Once there are enough users that have rated the new version, a new overview rating appears. You can view the reset date in the Distribution tab under Ratings and Reviews.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>Once you release the new version of your app, you won’t be able to restore the previous rating.</p>
</div>
<p>When you reset your app's overview rating, it affects all regions or countries simultaneously. Keep in mind that when you reset your overview rating, it won’t apply to written customer reviews, which will continue to display on the App Store.</p>
<p>For universal apps on the App Store, the reset only applies to the <a href="/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-platforms">platform version</a> that you reset your rating for. You can’t reset the rating of app bundles.</p>
