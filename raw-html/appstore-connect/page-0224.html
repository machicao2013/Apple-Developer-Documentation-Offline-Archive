<h1>Set up win-back offers</h1>
<p>If your app offers auto-renewable subscriptions, you have the option to set up win-back offers to encourage lapsed subscribers to re-subscribe on the App Store. You can configure offers in App Store Connect to be displayed to eligible customers on your product page and in your app. They may also appear in editorially curated selections and personalized recommendations across the App Store.</p>
<p>App Store Connect allows you to create a maximum of 350 win-back offers per subscription. You can run a maximum of 5 win-back offers per storefront, per subscription at a time.</p>

<h3>Set up win-back offers</h3>
<div>
<ol class="compound-item-list">
<li>
<p>From Apps, select your app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the sidebar, click Subscriptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the subscription group containing your subscription. Your subscription needs to be approved by App Review before you can create a win-back offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the subscription, then go to the Subscription Prices section and click the add button (+).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Create Win-Back Offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a reference name for the offer. Use this reference name to manage the offer in App Store Connect. After you’ve created your offer, the reference name cannot be changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter an identifier for the offer.  This will allow you to identify sales associated with the offer in Sales and Trends reports and in StoreKit transactions. It must not have already been used for another offer in the same subscription group. After you’ve created your offer,  you can’t change the offer identifier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the date range for when this offer will be available. The earliest you can schedule your offer to go live is one day after today, and the event must run for a minimum of 3 days. Please note that <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/pricing-and-availability/app-store-pricing-and-availability-start-times-by-country-or-region">start dates and times vary by region</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose either Normal Priority or High Priority. Indicating an offer is high priority helps the App Store understand which of your offers are your most important business priorities. Along with other offer details, this informs how Apple ranks your offer in placements such as win-back offer sheets, customers' manage subscriptions page, and the App Store if you choose to promote your offer there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine which customers are eligible for the offer, based on how long they were paid subscribers and when their subscriptions ended.</p>

<p>Choose your country or region availability, then click Next.</p>
<p>App Store Connect informs you if your offer overlaps with any other scheduled offers. Overlap occurs when customers are eligible for more than one offer for the same subscription, based on specified offer dates, eligibility criteria, and country or region availability. If offers overlap, Apple automatically selects and displays one offer to eligible customers based on price, duration, and other factors such as the customer’s paid subscription tenure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose Pay as you go, Pay up front, or Free, then choose the appropriate duration and price. To search from a larger list of price points, click See Additional Prices. Click Next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App Store Connect provides comparable prices for all 175 App Store countries and regions, taking into account taxes and foreign exchange rates. If you want to set different prices for specific storefronts, make the changes and click Next.  After you’ve created your offer, you can’t change the price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the details of your offer are correct, and then click Confirm. After the offer is created, a redemption URL to the offer is generated. The offer will automatically display on the customers' Manage Subscriptions page and within your app once the start date is reached. In order for your offer to appear on the App Store, make sure you have an <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-in-app-purchases/view-and-edit-in-app-purchase-information#add-or-remove-an-image">approved image</a> for your subscription, and have <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/set-up-win-back-offers#promote-win-back-offers-on-the-app-store">promoted the offer</a>.
