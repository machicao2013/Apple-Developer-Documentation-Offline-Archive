<h1>Overview of receiving payments</h1>
<p>In order to receive payment from Apple for proceeds for your app or In-App Purchase, you must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have a Paid Apps Agreement in effect. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-agreements/sign-and-update-agreements">Learn more.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide banking information in App Store Connect. Payments are sent to the primary bank account on file at the time a payment is processed. Payments to multiple or split bank accounts aren't supported. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-banking-information/enter-banking-information">Learn more.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exceed the minimum monthly <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/reporting/minimum-payment-threshold">payment threshold</a> for each country or region in which you sell content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete any monthly invoicing requirements you’re subject to based on your country or region. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-tax-information/manage-invoices-and-other-tax-documents">Learn more.</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you meet those requirements, payments are made to the bank account and the <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-banking-information/enter-banking-information">currency you provided</a> within 45 days of the last day of the fiscal month in which the transaction was completed.</p>
<p>Payments are processed through direct deposit or electronic funds transfer (EFT). When available, payments are issued as low-value transfers rather than high-value wire transfers. Apple's bank consolidates proceeds for each currency in which you have App Store sales, resulting in a single payment to your bank per fiscal month. Payments may be subject to bank fees and transaction costs charged by your bank or intermediate financial institutions, reducing the amount that's deposited in your bank account.</p>
<p>Access the Payments and Financial Reports section in App Store Connect to view your outstanding <a href="/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/view-payments-and-proceeds">payments</a> , amounts paid, applied exchange rates, and more. You can also <a href="/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/download-financial-reports">download financial reports</a>, which are made available for the previous fiscal month’s earnings by the first Friday of the current fiscal month.</p>
<p>Financial reports show payments made to you based on closed transactions and finalized proceeds using the <a href="https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wa/jumpTo?page=fiscalcalendar" target="_blank">Apple fiscal calendar</a>. Reports only include paid transactions where we are able to collect payment from the customer (view Schedule 2 of your Apple Developer Agreement).</p>

<h3>Additional information</h3>
<p>If you have a Nepal-based bank account, your payments from Apple will be subject to a 5% advance income tax  (rate may be subject to change under the local tax regulations), deducted from your payment by the local correspondent bank and settled with the local tax authority in Nepal. Apple isn't responsible for deducting or remitting this tax to the local tax authority.</p>

</sf-symbol> FAQs</h3>
<div>
<h3>What is the exchange rate applied to my payments?</h3>
<p>Our bank converts payment amounts into the currency of your bank account. The exchange rate is established by our bank and, due to Apple's volume, is generally a more favorable rate than used by your local bank. The rates are typically the spot rate on the date of payment and no more than three business days prior to the date the proceeds are received into your account.</p>
<h3>Why am I not receiving financial report notifications?</h3>
<p>If financial reports are available for your account and you have not been receiving the related email notifications, confirm that your user profile is set up to <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/view-and-edit-your-profile">receive financial report notifications</a>. If these items are set up correctly, check your email client and/or spam filter to make sure the email address do-not-reply@apple.com isn't being blocked.</p>
