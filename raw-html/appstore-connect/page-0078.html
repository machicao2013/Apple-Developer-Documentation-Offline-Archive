<h1>App Store Connect workflow</h1>
<p>Use <a href="http://appstoreconnect.apple.com/">App Store Connect</a> to submit apps for distribution, manage your apps, distribute beta versions using <span class="force-glossary">TestFlight</span>,  accept legal agreements, enter tax and banking information, view trends and financial reports, and more. The <a href="/app-store-connect/api/">App Store Connect API</a> is also available to automate your workflow.</p>
<p>Initially, only the Account Holder can sign in to App Store Connect using the Apple Account associated with their Apple Developer Program membership.</p>
<p>The Account Holder can invite additional users in the Users and Access section.</p>
<div class="Task no-header">
<h3>Accept the agreement, and enter tax and banking information</h3>
<p>If you want to sell your apps or offer In-App Purchases on the App Store, visit the Business section to sign the Paid Apps Agreement. Then, enter <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-banking-information/enter-banking-information">banking</a> and <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-tax-information/provide-tax-information">tax information</a>.</p>
<h3>Add users and assign roles</h3>
<p>To delegate responsibilities to others, visit the Users and Access section and <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/add-and-edit-users">add users</a> by entering their names and email addresses. They can then perform tasks based on the roles you assign them. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/overview-of-accounts-and-roles">Learn about roles.</a></p>
<h3>Add your app and upload a build</h3>
<p>In the Apps section, <a href="/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-a-new-app">create an app record</a> so your app’s information, such as name, keywords, and description, is ready for distribution. You don’t need to finish creating your app in Xcode before entering its information in App Store Connect. However, you must create an app record before you can upload a build of your app. You can <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/upload-builds">upload multiple builds</a>, and then view the builds and <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/view-builds-and-metadata">variants</a> in App Store Connect.</p>
<h3>Test and submit your app</h3>
<p>Distribute your app for testing using <a href="/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/testflight-overview">TestFlight</a>, which supports apps for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS. You can <a href="/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/add-internal-testers">add internal testers</a> and <a href="/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/invite-external-testers">invite external testers</a> who'll use the <span class="force-glossary">TestFlight app</span> to install your app on their devices. When your app is ready for distribution, <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/choose-a-build-to-submit">choose the build you want to submit</a> and <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/overview-of-submitting-for-review">send it to App Review</a>. You can continue improving your app by <a href="/help/app-store-connect/update-your-app/create-a-new-version">creating new versions</a> periodically.</p>
<h3>Monitor your apps status, usage, and sales</h3>
<p>You can <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/view-app-status-history">monitor the status of your app</a> as it goes through App Review. Once it’s live on the App Store, you can gain insights on its performance through <a href="/help/app-store-connect/measure-app-performance/overview-of-reporting-tools">App Analytics, Sales and Trends, and Payments and Financial Reports</a>, and <a href="/help/app-store-connect/monitor-ratings-and-reviews/respond-to-reviews">respond to user reviews</a> on the App Store. App Store Connect for iPhone and iPad also lets you view some of this information and perform other tasks.</p>
