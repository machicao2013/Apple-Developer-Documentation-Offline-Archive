<h1>Manage Streamlined Purchasing</h1>
<p>If your subscription offers contingent pricing or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/set-up-win-back-offers">win-back offers</a>, you have the option to disable streamlined purchasing for your app. Streamlined purchasing allows customers to purchase auto-renewable subscriptions directly from the App Store.</p>
<p>Streamlined purchasing is enabled by default. If your subscription requires steps at the time of purchase, such as signing into the app, you can choose to turn off streamlined purchasing. When turned off, customers will have to go into your app to complete subscription purchases.</p>
<p>Before you can turn off streamlined purchasing, your latest approved binary must include the necessary <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/purchaseintent">StoreKit APIs</a>. Turning off streamlined purchasing will apply to subscriptions merchandised on the App Store like Contingent Pricing and Win-back Offers. It doesn’t apply to the subscription offer codes or In-App Purchase promo codes redemptions from the App Store or redemption URL.</p>
