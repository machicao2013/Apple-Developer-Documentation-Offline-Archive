<h2>Comparing Sales and Trends with Payments and Financial Reports</h2>
<p>Differences between reports in Sales and Trends and those in Payments and Financial may occur for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Processing status. </b>Processing and closing transactions may take time. Transactions initiated in a particular month may not appear in Sales and Trends Reports until the customer's payment is processed, collected, and invoiced, possibly in the following fiscal month. Additionally, transactions without collected payments don't appear in financial reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Exchange rate. </b>Sales and Trends estimates sales and proceeds in USD using a rolling average of previous month's exchange rates. All downloadable reports display amounts in local currencies as transacted by customers. Payments and Financial Reports finalize payments using the exchange rate applied to convert each report’s currency to your bank account’s currency. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/overview-of-receiving-payments">Learn about the exchange rate.</a></p>

<h2>Comparing App Analytics and Sales and Trends</h2>
<p>Differences may occur between sales reports in App Analytics and those in Sales and Trends for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>App Analytics data is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). By default, Sales and Trends data is shown in UTC, but you can change the timezone to Pacific Time (PT).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App Analytics excludes Restores (where a user restores an app to their device from a backup) in the Redownloads metric, while Sales and Trends includes Restores in its Redownload count.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App Analytics excludes sales metrics (In-App Purchases, sales, paying users, proceeds) from TestFlight builds, while Sales and Trends includes them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App Analytics excludes Sales or Redownloads on watchOS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App Analytics excludes In-App Purchase transactions (such as auto-renewable subscription renewals) from Removed from Sale apps, while Sales and Trends includes them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certain transactions may not be reported on the same dates in App Analytics and Sales and Trends due to processing time differences between the two systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
