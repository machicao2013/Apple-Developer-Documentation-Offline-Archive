<h1>Measure your first annual installs</h1>
<p>If you have accepted the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU (available for apps in the European Union), you'll begin accumulating first annual installs for your EU apps.</p>
<p>Use the following two reports to monitor how many first annual installs your apps receive. If any of your apps exceed one million first annual installs, or if you're distributing an app marketplace, you’ll also receive monthly financial reports which will inform you of the amount owed. Nonprofit organizations, accredited educational institutions, and government entities who are approved for a <a href="/support/fee-waiver/">fee waiver</a> will also receive the first annual install reports but not the financial report since they are exempt from the Core Technology Fee, subject to the Apple Developer Program’s existing rules.</p>
<p>If you have not signed the Alternative Terms Addendum, you can use App Install Reports from 2023 to <a href="/help/app-store-connect/understanding-the-core-technology-fee/estimate-fees-for-alternative-business-terms">estimate your Core Technology Fee</a>.</p>

</sf-symbol> FAQs</h3>
<div>
<h3 class="Name">How does Apple know how many installs my apps are getting?</h3>
<p>Apple provides secure installation APIs that can be called by the App Store, web distribution developers, or alternative app marketplaces to request the installation of iOS and iPadOS apps. This API, along with a signal when the installation is complete, enables Apple to accurately count how many times an app is installed.</p>
<h3 class="Name">How will Apple protect developers from install spam?</h3>
<p>Apple already takes a number of steps to prevent fraud and scams and protect developers’ intellectual property. Apple is implementing additional measures to monitor, detect, and prevent install abuse, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>An install verification mechanism to ensure that all installs come from real Apple devices.</li>
<li>Limits on the number of first annual installs that can come from a single device.</li>
<li>Investigating, and potentially terminating, user or developer accounts that engage in suspicious behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a developer believes that their app’s install count was inflated by install spam, they’ll be able to <a href="/support/">contact us</a>.</p>
