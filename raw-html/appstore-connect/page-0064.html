<h1>Apply a test treatment to your product page</h1>
<p>You can apply any of the treatments to your original product page on the App Store, as well as to versions in the Ready for Distribution or Prepare for Submission states, at any time. You can apply one treatment per test, and the action can't be undone. Keep in mind that only the app previews and screenshots from the treatment will be applied. To apply changes to the app icon, set it as the default icon in your next app version.</p>
