<h1>Manage availability of iPhone and iPad apps on Apple Vision Pro</h1>
<p>Your iPhone and iPad apps will be available to users on Apple Vision Pro unless you edit their availability in App Store Connect. These apps will run natively, using the same frameworks, resources, and runtime environment as they do on iOS and iPadOS.</p>
<p>If your iOS app offers <a href="/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-platforms/">universal purchase</a> and also supports visionOS, the option to offer the iOS app on the App Store on Apple Vision Pro won’t be available. Additionally, if your iOS app is available on Apple Vision Pro through universal purchase and you add the visionOS platform in App Store Connect, publishing the visionOS version will replace the iOS version on Apple Vision Pro. Current users of the iOS app will automatically receive the visionOS update on Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p>You can choose to make your iPhone and iPad apps available or not available on the App Store for Apple Vision Pro. This is set at the app level and applies to all versions of your app.</p>
