<h1>Initiate an app transfer</h1>
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need the Apple Account for the <span class="no-glossary">Account Holder</span> in the receiving organization and your app must meet the <a href="/help/app-store-connect/transfer-an-app/app-transfer-criteria">criteria for an app transfer</a>.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Because an app is removed from your account after an app transfer, you should back up all information about the app for your records. It’s a good idea to keep a record of your appʼs <span class="force-glossary">metadata</span> and pricing, note dates the app was available on the App Store, and save sales and download information.</p>
<p><b>Required role: </b>Account Holder. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions">View role permissions.</a></p>

<div class="Task">
<p>After you initiate the transfer, the app stays in its previous status, with the Pending App Transfer status added, until the recipient accepts it or the transfer expires after 60 days.</p>
<p>While the app is in the Pending App Transfer state, you (the transferor) can’t edit some app information, like metadata, pricing, availability, and In-App Purchases. Any open App Review communications are closed. If the app is part of a Game Center group, the recipient can’t make changes to the group.</p>
<p>The transferor and the recipient can cancel an app transfer in <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/go/itunesconnect/contracts" target="_blank">Business</a> while it is still in the Waiting for Recipient state. To cancel the transfer, the transferor must click Cancel Transfer next to the app in the App Transfers section of the Agreements tab.</p>
