<h1>Create offer codes for In-App Purchases</h1>
<p>Offer codes provide a way to acquire, retain, and win back customers by offering discounted or free access to In-App Purchases. You create and manage offer codes in App Store Connect, defining the eligibility criteria for redemption. Customers can redeem offer codes through a redemption URL, or by entering the code directly in the App Store, or within your app. You can have up to 10 active offers at a time, with a limit of 1 million codes per app, per quarter.</p>
<p>You define the eligibility criteria for who can redeem the code, including users who:</p>
<div class="spacing-bottom">
<ul class="compound-item-list">
<li>
<p>Never purchased within your app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purchased within your app in the last 30 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purchased within your app more than 30 days ago.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can create offer and sandbox codes for your app regardless of its current App Status. However, to generate custom or unique offer codes, your app must be Ready for Distribution, and the associated In-App Purchase must be Approved.</p>
<p>Carefully consider your offer's eligibility requirements before creating and distributing offer codes.</p>
</div>
<p>There are three types of offer codes available:</p>
<h3>One-time-use codes</h3>
<p>Unique, randomly generated codes that can each be redeemed only once.</p>
<div class="spacing-bottom">
<ul class="compound-item-list">
<li>
<p><b>How customers redeem:</b> Customers can redeem these codes through a unique redemption URL, by manually entering the code in the App Store, or directly within your app (if your app supports it). You can set set an expiration date with a maximum of 6 months, after which the code will no longer be valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>In-app redemption requirement:</b> Redemption within your app requires the customer to be using a device running iOS 16.3, macOS 15.0, or visionOS 1.0 or later, and your app must support the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/supporting-subscription-offer-codes-in-your-app">appropriate StoreKit method</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Best for:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Small-scale distribution (i.e., giving codes to individuals as a special discount, or contest winners).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Situations where you need strict control over who can redeem the offer (i.e., a limited-quantity giveaway, codes for event attendees only, or a codes to print on a product).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Targeted promotions with limited distribution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Redemption:</b> Each app can have up to 1 million codes per quarter, shared across all In-App Purchases. Customers are limited to redeeming one code per offer. Codes will expire after a maximum of six months. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Custom codes</h3>
<p>Codes you create yourself, using a unique name (i.e., <code>SUMMER25</code>, <code>VIPACCESS</code>). Unlike one-time use codes, a custom code can be redeemed by multiple users, up to a limit you set.</p>
<div class="spacing-bottom">
<ul class="compound-item-list">
<li>
<p><b>How customers redeem:</b> Customers can redeem these codes through a redemption URL or directly within your app (if your app supports it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>In-app redemption requirement:</b> Redemption within your app requires the customer to be using a device running iOS 16.3, macOS 15.0, or visionOS 1.0 or later, and your app must support the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/supporting-subscription-offer-codes-in-your-app">appropriate StoreKit method</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Best for:</b></p>
<ul class="compound-item-list">
<li>
<p>Large-scale marketing campaigns (i.e., promoting a discount to all new users).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotions targeted at specific customer groups (i.e., offering a special deal to users who haven't opened the app in 30 days).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acquiring, retaining, or winning back specific customer cohorts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Redemption:</b> Each app can have up to 1 million codes per quarter, shared across all In-App Purchases. Customers are limited to redeeming one code per offer. Codes will expire after a maximum of six months. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Sandbox codes</h3>
<p>One-time use codes for testing purposes. You can test offer redemptions through your sandbox Account settings on iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 or later, and if your app supports the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/supporting-subscription-offer-codes-in-your-app">appropriate StoreKit method</a>.</p>
<div class="spacing-bottom">
<ul class="compound-item-list">
<li>
<p><b>Best for:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Verifying the end-to-end offer code redemption flow in your app's sandbox environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing different offer configurations (such as price) without affecting real users or production data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirming that your app correctly handles receipt validation and entitlement granting processes for offer code redemptions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Redemption limits:</b> Each app can distribute up to 10,000 sandbox test codes per quarter, shared across all In-App Purchases. Sandbox test accounts have no redemption limits; if redemptions are blocked, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/testing-in-app-purchases-with-sandbox#Clear-the-purchase-history-for-a-Sandbox-Apple-Account">clear the purchase history for the sandbox Apple account</a> and retest. Code expiration is optional for sandbox test codes.</p>
