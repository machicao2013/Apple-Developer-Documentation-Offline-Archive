<h1>Configure test treatments</h1>
<p>By default, test treatments are copies of your app’s original App Store product page. You can edit the app icon, screenshots, and previews of each treatment. If you choose not to edit one of these items, the metadata from your original product page will display for that item.</p>
<p>Before testing, ensure all metadata in your test treatments is approved. You can submit this metadata without submitting a new version of your app. However, any app icons you wish to use must be part of the app binary for the current App Store version, which should be built with Xcode 13 or later and support alternate icons in asset catalogs through an appropriate SDK.</p>
<p>If you’re simply changing the order of screenshots or previews that are already on the App Store, or only modifying the app icon, your metadata is already approved and you don’t need to resubmit.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a treatment name, then click OK.</p>
</li>

<p>Click the App Icon tab, which displays if your app binary includes more than one icon. Ensure any icons you want to use are part of the app binary currently on the App Store. This app version must be built with an SDK that supports alternate icons in asset catalogs. Icons must also be sized to 1024x1024 pixels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Change under under the icon of the treatment you want to change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose an icon from the menu that appears. This menu shows all app icons included in your app’s binary. If an app is downloaded from a product page with a test treatment, the test treatment app icon displays throughout the download process and on the user’s device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the device tabs and add screenshots and previews. If you choose not to edit screenshots or previews for a certain device size, the treatment will use the ones on your original product page for that device size.
