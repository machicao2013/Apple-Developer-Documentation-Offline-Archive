<h1>Add and edit users</h1>
<p>You can add and edit users in Users and Access.</p>
<p>If you’re enrolled in the Apple Developer Program as an individual, you can give up to 50 additional users access to your content in App Store Connect. These users only access App Store Connect—they're not part of your team and won't receive other membership benefits.</p>
<p>If your organization is enrolled in the Apple Developer Program, you can add members to your team. All users receive access to App Store Connect and all other membership resources and benefits.</p>
