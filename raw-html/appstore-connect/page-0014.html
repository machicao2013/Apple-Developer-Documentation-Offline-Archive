<h1>Manage leaderboard sets</h1>
<p>Leaderboard sets organize several leaderboards into a single unit. For example, in a game that includes many levels, you could define a leaderboard set to organize the leaderboards for each level.</p>
<p>The limit to how many leaderboards you can create per app differs based on whether it’s with or without leaderboard sets:</p>
<p>Without Leaderboard sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Up to 100 leaderboards per app</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With Leaderboard sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Up to 500 leaderboards total per app</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maximum 100 leaderboard sets per app</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximum 100 leaderboards per set</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You must have at least one leaderboard for your app before you can create a leaderboard set. After you add leaderboard sets to your app, all future leaderboards that you configure for the app must be included in a leaderboard set.</p>
<p>The process to start using leaderboard sets to organize your app’s leaderboards includes these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create the first leaderboard set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create additional leaderboard sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add new leaderboards directly into leaderboard sets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you create the first leaderboard set, App Store Connect ensures that all existing leaderboards for the app are included in at least one leaderboard set.</p>
<p>Leaderboard sets and their leaderboard must be approved before they are available to players. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-game-center-components">Learn how to submit Game Center components for review.</a></p>

<p>You can add new leaderboard sets to your app to further customize how your leaderboards are displayed.
