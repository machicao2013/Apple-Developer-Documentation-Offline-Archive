<h3>Set up an advanced App Clip experience with place association</h3>
<div>
<p>Connecting your App Clip to a physical location is optional through a place association. This feature is necessary for launching the App Clip experience via Apple Maps. Place association doesn’t guarantee inclusion in Apple Maps and may not be available in all countries and regions.</p>
<p>If your App Clip is part of the location’s official app, it’ll be automatically approved for that location.  If it’s not part of the official app, either the business owner must claim the location through <a href="https://businessconnect.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple Business Connect</a> and approve the App Clip to display, or the creator of the App Clip must be authorized as a partner on the business’ website.</p>
