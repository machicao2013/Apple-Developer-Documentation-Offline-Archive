<h1>View app metrics</h1>
<p>App metrics are divided into four categories: App Store, Downloads, Sales, and Usage.</p>
<div class="Subhead">
<h3>App Store</h3>
<p class="spacing-top-paragraph">Find out how many times your app was viewed on the App Store, and how many times users have visited your app’s product page.</p>
</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h3>Downloads</h3>
<p class="spacing-top-paragraph">View how many total times your app was downloaded and which of those were first-time downloads and re-downloads.</p>
</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h3>Sales</h3>
<p class="spacing-top-paragraph">View the total number of pre-orders, first-time app downloads, In-App Purchases, and their associated sales. You can also view how many unique paying users your app has.</p>
</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p class="spacing-top-paragraph">Track a variety of user engagement metrics, such as installations, <span class="force-glossary">sessions</span>, <span class="force-glossary">crashes</span>, and active devices. Usage metrics are only available from users who have agreed to share their diagnostics and usage information with app developers. Usage data isn't currently available for apps downloaded through the Games app. <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT202100">Learn more</a>.</p>

<p>The App Analytics dashboard shows App Store data for your chosen date range, along with the estimated percentage change from the previous period of the same length. For example, if you select “Last 7 days,” the percentage values will show if your app is performing better or worse than the week prior. You can also <a href="/help/app-store-connect/view-app-analytics/download-app-analytics-reports">download your apps’ data</a> from App Analytics by using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/analytics">the App Store Connect API</a>.</p>
