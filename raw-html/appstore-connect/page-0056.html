<h1>Remove an app</h1>
<p>To remove an app from your main view in Apps, you must first <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/manage-availability-for-your-app-on-the-app-store">remove it from the App Store</a> for all countries and regions, even if the app was never released. Also, <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-in-app-purchases/set-availability-for-in-app-purchases">remove any associated In-App Purchases from sale</a>. For alternative app distribution, you must also <a href="/help/app-store-connect/managing-alternative-distribution/manage-distribution-on-an-alternative-app-marketplace">remove the app from marketplace distribution</a>. To do this, deselect the app from each marketplace in the Integrations tab under Users and Access.</p>
<p>You can’t remove apps that are in the following states: Ready for Review, Waiting for Review, In Review, Metadata Rejected, or Rejected. Apps that are actively being transferred to another account or are part of an app bundle also can’t be removed. If the app is part of an app bundle and hasn’t been approved yet, you must remove it from the bundle before it can be removed from your main view in Apps. App bundles can’t be removed.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="Warning"><b>WARNING: </b>If you remove an app, you’ll lose ownership of the app name. Removed apps can only be restored if the name isn’t currently in use by another developer account. In addition, the <span class="force-glossary">SKU</span> can’t be reused in the same organization and if you’ve uploaded a build, your bundle ID can’t be reused.</p>
