<h1>Overview of reporting tools</h1>
<p>App Store Connect provides the following reporting tools to help you measure the performance of your apps and In-App Purchases on the App Store.</p>
<div class="Subhead">
<h2>App Analytics</h2>
<p>App Analytics lets you measure user engagement, marketing campaigns, and monetization for your apps and In-App Purchases distributed on the App Store. You can use App Analytics to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find out which sources drive the most traffic to your app’s product page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate conversion rate (the number of people who view your app’s product page to total downloads and pre-orders of your app).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find out which countries or regions have the most engaged users by sessions and proceeds per paying user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare your app’s performance to the performance of similar apps so you can put your performance into context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find out which App Clips are successful at driving first-time app downloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View how many users have pre-ordered your app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the performance of different product page treatments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download data for your apps in bulk, including data about App Store engagement, app usage, and commerce.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>App Analytics provides app developers with usage data collected from users who have agreed in to share their diagnostics on devices running iOS 8 and later, macOS 11 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and visionOS 1 and later. To protect user privacy, App Analytics only shows data after a certain number of data points are available. App Analytics doesn’t include data from watchOS.</p>

Data in Sales and Trends is recorded when a customer initiates a transaction on the App Store. Sales data for iMessage apps and sticker packs is included in the data for the containing iOS app.</p>

<p>View top apps or In-App Purchases and their contribution to your overall business.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>View units, proceeds, sales and pre-orders with options to filter data by selected time period, app, subscription, and country or region.</p>
