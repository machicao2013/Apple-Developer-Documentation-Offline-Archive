<p>You can create apps for Apple Watch using the watchOS 6 SDK, either as iOS apps with a watchOS app or as watchOS-only apps.</p>
<p>To prepare watchOS apps for distribution on the App Store, add an iOS app to App Store Connect and then include additional information specific to your app.</p>
<p>Ensure your description includes the app's functionality on Apple Watch. Provide screenshots of Apple Watch and an app icon. App Review reviews your screenshots and icon after you submit your new app version.</p>
