<h1>Manage availability for your app on the App Store</h1>
<p>Before submitting your app for review on the App Store, you must set its availability. You can release your app in any of the 175 countries or regions where the App Store is available, and you can <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/publish-for-pre-order">offer your app for pre-order</a> in regions where it hasn’t yet been published.</p>
<p>A customer’s Apple Account country or region setting determines the App Store country or region where they can purchase apps. For example, if an account is set to Japan, purchases are limited to apps from the Japanese App Store.</p>
<p>Your app may not be available for download or use in some countries or regions due to legal or regulatory requirements. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/manage-availability-for-your-app-on-the-app-store/#view-the-status-of-your-apps-availability-on-the-app-store-in-a-specific-country-or-region">View your app's App Store statuses to learn more.</a> </p>
