<h1>View units, proceeds, sales, and pre-orders</h1>
<p>Sales and Trends estimates the USD amount of sales and proceeds on the App Store, based on a rolling average of the previous month's exchange rates.</p>
<p>By default, data is shown in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). To match the timezone used by downloaded reports, select Pacific Time (PT). A day includes transactions that happened from 12:00 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. for the selected timezone.</p>
<h3><b>Units</b></h3>
<p>By default, the Units section display app units, In-App Purchases, and app bundles. You can apply filters to view the number of updates, redownloads, and app units originated from pre-orders.</p>
<h3><b>App and bundle units</b></h3>
<p>The number of first-time purchases of your app or bundle. An app unit or bundle unit is counted when a customer taps the 'Buy' or 'Get' button for the first-time. Subsequent app updates, downloads to different devices under the same Apple Account, and redownloads to the same device aren't counted as new app units. Family Sharing downloads are counted as app units for free apps but are excluded for paid apps.</p>
<h3><b>In-App Purchases</b></h3>
<p>The number of In-App Purchases, including consumables, non-consumables, auto-renewable subscriptions, and non-renewable subscriptions. In-App Purchases restored by users aren’t counted. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/in-app-purchases-and-subscriptions/in-app-purchase-types">Learn about the types of In-App Purchase types.</a></p>
<h3><b>Sales</b></h3>
<p>The total amount billed to customers for purchasing apps, app bundles, and In-App Purchases. Sales are inclusive of any applicable taxes we collect and remit per Schedule 2 of the Paid Apps Agreement. Sales for iMessage apps and sticker packs are included in the data for the containing iOS app.</p>
<h3><b>Proceeds</b></h3>
<p>The amount of money you receive on sales of your apps and In-App Purchases. This is the Customer Price minus applicable taxes and Apple’s commission, per Schedule 2 of your Paid Apps Agreement. Proceeds in Sales and Trends aren’t final. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/overview-of-receiving-payments">Learn about final proceeds based on closed transactions.</a></p>
<p>For paid subscriptions active for less than one year, you receive 70% of the subscription price, excluding applicable taxes. This is referred to as the Rate Before One Year.  After a subscriber accumulates one year of paid service, you receive 85% of the subscription price, minus applicable taxes, known as the Rate After One Year.</p>
<h3><b>Pre-orders</b></h3>
<p>Before releasing your app on the App Store in a country or region for the first time, you can choose to offer it as a pre-order. People can order your app before it’s released and it’ll automatically download onto their devices on release day. A pre-order is counted as an app unit upon fulfillment to a customer. If it's a paid pre-order, the sale is recorded upon fulfillment.</p>

<h3>Why are there more updates than the total downloaded units in Sales and Trends?</h3>
<p>Your total downloaded units are based on unique users. Updates are counted on every device on which they’re installed, even when the device shares the same Apple Account. If you release frequent updates of your app, there may be significantly more updates than total downloads.</p>
