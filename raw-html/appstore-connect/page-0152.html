<h1>Overview of Apple-hosted asset packs</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundassets">Background Assets framework</a> allows you to schedule background downloads of additional content using your server or content delivery network (CDN). Starting with iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26, if you use Managed Background Assets, the system automatically manages downloads, updates, compression, and more for your assets. Additionally, you can choose to use Apple-Hosted Background Assets for apps distributed through TestFlight and the App Store, and Apple will host the content on your behalf.</p>
<p>Assets for Managed Background Assets are managed through asset packs that you configure using a command-line packaging tool in Xcode. These asset packs can be downloaded by users independent of an app build. When you use Apple hosting, asset packs can also be uploaded to App Store Connect independent of an app build.</p>
