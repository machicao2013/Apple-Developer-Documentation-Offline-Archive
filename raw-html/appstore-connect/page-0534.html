<h1>View App Clip metrics</h1>
<p>App Analytics helps you analyze the performance of your App Clips.</p>
<p>When your App Clip card displays, it’s counted as an App Clip Card View. If the user launches the App Clip by tapping the action button on the App Clip card, the App Clip installs on the user’s device and is counted as an App Clip Installation. It remains on the device until there are 30 consecutive days of inactivity. If the user returns to your App Clip for at least one second, an App Clip Session is counted. If the user clicks a link in your App Clip to download your app from the App Store, the resulting App Unit is attributed to your App Clip as the source, as well as any additional App Clip Sessions or Crashes.</p>
<p>App Clip metrics are only available from users who have agreed to share their diagnostics and usage information with app developers.</p>
