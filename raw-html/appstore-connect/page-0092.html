<h1>Understanding taxes</h1>
<p>As is standard for business transactions, commissions and fees don’t include taxes. There may be applicable taxes, as required by tax law, added as new lines on your invoice. Taxes may apply in certain countries and/or regions, including but not limited to, value-added tax (VAT), sales and use tax, sales and service tax (SST), goods and services tax (GST), consumption tax, etc. Generally, the applicability of tax depends on a combination of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your business location (your legal entity address provided when enrolling in the Apple Developer Program).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax information that you provide to Apple (such as valid tax ID, exemption status, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The billing Apple legal entity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that any amount payable by you to Apple for commissions and fees is subject to any applicable withholding tax, and that you’re required to collect and remit such tax, you shall gross up the relevant payment to Apple, so that after you deduct and remit the applicable withholding tax to tax authority, Apple shall receive the same amount as originally invoiced. You shall bear full responsibility for such compliance obligations. If you apply any applicable withholding tax, please properly indicate on any withholding tax documentation the correct Apple legal entity issuing the specific invoice and provide Apple with tax remittance documentation.</p>
<p>For details, view the Developer Program License Agreement, the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/download/alternate_eu_terms_addendum.pdf">Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU</a>, or the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/download/external/StoreKit-External-Purchase-Link-(EU)-Entitlement-Addendum.pdf">StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement Addendum for EU Apps</a>. If you have questions, consult your tax adviser.</p>
<p>Some countries require a business status to be part of the program, so you may be required to provide tax information to prove you can be treated as a business-to-business customer.

<h3>Tax on alternative payment transactions</h3>
<div>
<p>For In-App Purchases made using alternative payment processing or linking out to a webpage, you're responsible for taxes, including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Determining if a transaction is taxable;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charging and collecting the taxes at the applicable rate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remitting the taxes to the appropriate taxing authority;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing any required documentation to the users or appropriate taxing authority; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meeting all other country-specific tax compliance obligations imposed as a result of making in-app sales subject to tax in the storefront country and/or your country of residence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're using alternative payment processing or linking out on a European Union (EU) storefront, you must provide Apple with an EU specific VAT ID that demonstrates you're registered to handle VAT payments. Only one EU VAT ID is necessary for all EU storefronts.</p>
