<h3>*e-Tax Invoice for South Korean Developers</h3>
<div>
<p>If you have a valid Business Registration Number (BRN) verified by Apple against NTS records, you’ll receive a Korea e-Tax Invoice (전자세금계산서) for commissions deducted by Apple from sales on the South Korea storefront each Apple fiscal month. You can use these e-tax invoices to claim input tax credit on your VAT returns.</p>
<p>Cash Receipts (현금영수증) will be issued in lieu of e-Tax Invoices with NTS designated numbers (010-000-1234) until our records show that BRN is validated and provided with sufficient supporting document. You can locate the cash receipt documents under Payments and Financial Reports and link them to your tax account at NTS HomeTax web portal.</p>
<p>The trading name and the Trade Representative name listed on your Korea Tax Form will appear on your e-Tax Invoice for commissions.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/">contact us</a> if you wish to update the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Trading name, or organization name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trade Representative name, or Account Holder name</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can transfer the Account Holder role to another employee on the team who has the legal authority to bind your organization to legal agreements.</p>

<h3>US 1099 tax forms</h3>
<div>
<p>The <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/reporting/apple-legal-entities">Apple legal entities</a> associated with each country or region where content is sold will issue a 1099-K form to US-based individuals or entities that meet the following requirements. Forms are mailed by January 31 of the following year:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your unadjusted gross sales for the calendar year were at least $5,000 (the total amount of your sales, unadjusted for Apple’s commissions, fees, refunds, and other adjustments).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that prior to calendar year 2024, the reporting threshold was:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your unadjusted gross sales for the calendar year were at least $20,000 (the total amount of your sales, unadjusted for Apple’s commissions, fees, refunds, and other adjustments), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than 200 transactions were made in your apps during the calendar year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that Apple won’t issue a US 1099-MISC tax form. Sales on the App Store are between you and the customer. You’re the seller of copyrighted works, and we make payments to you for products or goods, which are specifically exempt from reporting on Form 1099-MISC. However, these payments may still be reportable on Form 1099-K and may be taxable income to you.</p>
