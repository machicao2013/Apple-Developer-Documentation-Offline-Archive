<h1>Get an alternative distribution package ID</h1>
<p>If you're distributing your app outside of the App Store through an alternative app marketplace or website, in countries and regions where eligible, you’ll need an alternative distribution package ID for each version of your app being distributed. The distributing developer’s web server ingests the alternative distribution package, which contains the data needed to support app installation.</p>
<p>An alternative distribution package automatically generates for an app version if it meets the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your Account Holder agrees to the latest Developer Program License Agreement or the <a href="/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#distribution-eu">Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the European Union</a> making your account eligible for alternative distribution in at least one country or region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The app is <a href="/help/app-store-connect/managing-alternative-distribution/manage-distribution-on-an-alternative-app-marketplace">eligible for distribution on at least one marketplace</a> in App Store Connect. Or, if you’re distributing an app through alternative app marketplace or in the European Union (EU) through your own website, you’ve <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/alternative_marketplaces_and_web_distribution">added an alternative distribution domain</a> using the App Store Connect API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The build associated with the app version supports iOS (or iPadOS if you're distributing in the EU).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The app version is accepted on or after February 8, 2024, or the app version is Ready for Distribution, or Processing for Distribution, or Pending Developer Release, and its associated build is built with the iOS 16.1 SDK or later.</p>
