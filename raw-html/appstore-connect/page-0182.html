<h1>Set availability for In-App Purchases</h1>
<p>You have the option to make your In-App Purchase available in any of 175 countries or regions where the App Store is offered. A customer’s Apple Account country or region setting determines which storefront they can purchase content from the App Store. For example, an account set to Japan can only purchase apps from the App Store in Japan.</p>

<p>These changes will go into effect immediately.</p>
<p>When deselecting countries or regions where your In-App Purchase is available, consider the impact on users and any communications you might need to provide.</p>
<p>Before removing your In-App Purchase from sale, take the following steps to help ensure a smooth experience:</p>
<ul class="spacing-top-paragraph">
<li>
<p>Announce your intention to remove the In-App Purchase from sale and stop merchandising it within your app at least 31 days before removal and remove them from sale within App Store Connect. This lets people use up any consumable In-App Purchase products they purchased. You can leverage your own communication channels such as email, websites, and in-app messaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End any promotions of the In-App Purchases to discourage purchases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notify Apple of your intention to remove an In-App Purchase from sale. Apple reserves the right to offer refunds for unfulfilled In-App Purchases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
