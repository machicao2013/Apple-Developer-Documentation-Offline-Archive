<p>If you’re using Managed Background Assets and choose to have Apple host the assets on your behalf, you can use Transporter, the App Store Connect API, iTMSTransporter, or altool to upload asset packs to App Store Connect for testing in TestFlight and distribution on the App Store.</p>
<p>After you upload an asset pack, it needs to be processed in Apple’s system before it appears in App Store Connect. You’ll receive an email when this process is complete.</p>
<p>The Asset Pack ID you set in the manifest file, along with the app it belongs to, are used to uniquely identify the asset pack throughout the system. Its associated <span class="no-glossary">version number</span> will increment automatically with each new asset pack version you upload.</p>

<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>Starting in 2026, you’ll be required to use the -assetFile command instead of the -f command with your .ipa or .pkg files.
