<h2>Manually release a version to the App Store</h2>
<p>When <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/overview-of-submitting-for-review">submitting your app for review</a>, you can manually release a version. After approval, release it to the App Store once its status changes to Pending Developer Release.</p>
<p>Releasing an app version is specific to the platform you're working with. If there are app versions for other platforms also in "Pending Developer Release" that you want to release, you must manually release each one for every platform.</p>
<p>Apple will send you an email reminder if an app remains in Pending Developer Release status for more than 30 days.</p>
