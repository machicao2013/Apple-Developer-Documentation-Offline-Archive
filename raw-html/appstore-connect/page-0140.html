<h1>Set an app age rating</h1>
<p>An age rating is a required <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-information">app information</a> property that helps users assess the content and any potentially objectionable material within your app or game. This rating supports the functionality of parental controls, allowing parents and guardians to establish a safe online environment for children. As a developer, you can deliver age-appropriate experiences tailored for users across all age groups.</p>
<p>To determine the age rating of your app, respond to the age rating questionnaire in App Store Connect. This questionnaire includes a list of content descriptors, in-app controls, and capabilities that allow you to specify the frequency of each content type in your app. Your selections are then translated into an Apple global age rating, as well as additional region-specific ratings if required. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/age-ratings-values-and-definitions">Learn about age rating values and definitions.</a></p>
<p>This process helps you understand how different types of content can impact your app’s rating across various regions, enabling you to make informed declarations of frequency of the content and features in your app.</p>
<p>Depending on your responses, an age rating is assigned to each country or region based on their specific age suitability standards. This rating will be displayed on the App Store for that country or region and will remain consistent across all platforms.
