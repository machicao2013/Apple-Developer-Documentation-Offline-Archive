<h3>Select country or region availability</h3>
<div>
<p>The Country or Region Availability setting controls where your event appears on the App Store and Apple Games. By default, your event is set to appear on all storefronts. However, its visibility is determined by your app’s availability in those regions. You can select the date and time your event first becomes discoverable to users, as well as the date and time the event starts and ends.</p>

<h3>Add additional information</h3>
<div>
<ol class="compound-item-list">
<li>
<p>Provide an event deep link. This link takes users who tap Open on the In-App Event card or details page to the event content within your app. This can be a universal link (recommended for security) or custom URL. Avoid using URL shorteners and other services that add unnecessary redirects. Test the deep link to make sure it directs to the proper destination within your app — for example, you can paste your URL into the Notes app and tap it. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content">Learn about configuring universal links</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the general purpose of your event to help make sure your event reaches the most relevant users on the App Store and Apple Games.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the priority for your event. Events appear chronologically on the product page based on start time, with the soonest start time displaying first. If you designate an event as High Priority, it will appear ahead of Normal Priority events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicate if an In-App Purchase is required to participate in the event, as this information is shown on your event details page. For subscription apps, you only need to indicate that an In-App Purchase is required when there’s an additional cost for the event specifically — for example, a pay-per-view event in a subscription app that requires an In-App Purchase in addition to the standard subscription.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose your event’s primary language. This will be the default language that displays to users if your event isn’t localized for their device’s language.</p>
