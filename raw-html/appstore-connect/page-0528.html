<h1>Manage campaigns</h1>
<p>App Analytics enables you to generate campaign links for use in your marketing materials. When a user clicks an ad with your campaign link, they’re redirected to your app's product page on the App Store. Generating a campaign link also provides you with a campaign token and a provider token, which can be used in future campaigns.</p>

<h3>View campaign performance</h3>
<div>
<p>In App Analytics, campaigns appear only after a minimum of 24 hours since their launch and after receiving at least five first-time downloads. Ensure your campaign includes both a provider token and a campaign token.</p>
<p>When a user downloads your app for the first time within 24 hours of using your campaign link or campaign token, they’re counted as a First-Time Download. If a user clicks more than one campaign link within a given timeframe, only the most recent link receives credit for subsequent sales.</p>
