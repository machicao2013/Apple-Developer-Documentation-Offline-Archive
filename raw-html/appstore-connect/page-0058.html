<h1>Set your developer name</h1>
<p>By default, your legal name is used as your developer name. If you enrolled in the Apple Developer Program as an organization, you can set a different developer name if it's a registered trade name, DBA, or fictitious business name. For example, if your legal name is “Apps Company LLC”, your trade name can simply be “Apps Company”, which is used for distribution.</p>
<p>If you’re enrolled as an individual, this option isn’t available to you and the developer name is the same as your legal name.</p>
<div class="Task">
<p>You can set your developer name only when adding an app to your account for the first time. You can't edit or update this name later, so it's important to enter it correctly.</p>
