<h1>Localize app information</h1>
<p>After <a href="/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-a-new-app">adding an app to your account</a>, you can add languages and localized metadata on the App Information page. Learn more about <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-store-localizations">supported languages</a> and <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/required-localizable-and-editable-properties">localizable properties</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if you select English as the primary language for your app in App Store Connect, and it’s the only language you provide, your app metadata will appear in English in all <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-store-localizations">App Store countries or regions</a>. If you localize your app metadata in French, the French localization displays to users whose language setting is in French. The French localization also displays to users in countries or regions where the App Store supports French but not English. Users can search for your app using localized keywords in all countries or regions where the App Store supports French. If no localization matches a user's language setting, the next most relevant localization is used. In other countries or regions, your metadata displays in the primary language (English in this example).</p>
<p>Languages on the App Information page in App Store Connect are part of your app's metadata. This differs from adding languages to your app in Xcode when you localize your binary. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localization">Learn about localizing your app binary.</a></p>

<h3>Add a language</h3>
<div class="Task">
<p>When you add a language to your app, screenshots and the properties for the new language default to those of the primary language, except for the description and keywords. When you add a localization from the <a href="/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-platforms">platform version section</a>, it’s automatically added to the shared metadata under <a href="/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/view-and-edit-app-information">App Information</a> and to other platforms.</p>

<h3>Change the primary language</h3>
<div>
<p>You can change the primary language for an app. For a language to be selectable as the primary language:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You must have already <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/localize-app-information#add-a-language">added the language</a> to a previous version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App Review must approve the new language. If the language hasn’t been approved, submit a version with this localized metadata for approval. Then, select it as your primary language in a subsequent update.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must have already uploaded and received App Review approval for screenshots in the language for all supported platforms. The screenshot sizes for this language must match those of your current primary language. If this localization's screenshots were previously derived from another localization, you must first manually upload new screenshots that match your current primary language's sizes and submit a version for approval. Then, change the primary language on a subsequent update. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/upload-app-previews-and-screenshots">Learn more about adding screenshots and previews.</a></p>

<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>If your app has a <a href="/help/app-store-connect/create-custom-product-pages/configure-multiple-product-page-versions">custom product page</a> configured, you must also have uploaded screenshots in the language for each custom product page.</p>
