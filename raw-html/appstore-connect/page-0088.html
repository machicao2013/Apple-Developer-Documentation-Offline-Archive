<h3>Update your account for invoicing requirements</h3>
<p>Before your first invoice is issued, make sure you’ve <a href="/help/app-store-connect/making-payments-to-apple/update-your-account-for-invoicing-requirements">updated your account for invoicing requirements</a>, otherwise you may be invoiced without the applicable tax treatment applied or in the default currency.</p>

<h3>Report any necessary purchases to Apple</h3>
<p>If your app offers alternative payments or is linking out, you’re required to use the External Purchase Server API to report transactions to Apple for calculation and collection purposes. Required reporting includes refunds, corrections, renewals, one-time purchases, and transactions which didn’t result in a purchase. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/externalpurchaseserverapi">Learn about implementing the External Purchase Server API</a>.</p>

<h3>Download your invoice and report</h3>
<p>Invoices and reports will be available for download in App Store Connect approximately 15 calendar days after the end of a month where you’ve accrued fees.</p>
</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h3>Download your account statement</h3>

<h3>Remit payments to Apple</h3>
<p>You’ll need to provide payment to Apple within 30 days of the invoice date. You can pay directly from your bank using a unique virtual routing number for your developer account that’s provided on the invoice.</p>
<p>When remitting payments to Apple, please ensure that you use the correct banking details that are quoted on your invoice. To ensure prompt allocation of your payment to your account, please ensure that you quote your invoice number with your payment.</p>
<p>Please allow up to 5 working days for your payment to be allocated to your account.</p>
<p>If you’re sending a remittance advice along with your payment, please ensure that it’s sent to <a href="mailto:servicesremittances@apple.com">servicesremittances@apple.com</a>.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>If you have multiple invoices, they must all be paid separately. Invoices can’t be combined for a single payment.</p>

</div>
<div class="Subhead">
<h3>Late payments</h3>
<p>Please note that late payments accrue interest and nonpayment may result in the offset of App Store In-App Purchase proceeds owed to you, the app being blocked from distribution, or removal from the Apple Developer Program.</p>
<p>If your invoice is 5 days past due, an email is sent to the Account Holder, Admin, and Finance users letting them know that updates to apps will be blocked if payment is not received within the next 10 days.</p>
<p>If your invoice is 50 days past due, another email will be sent to the Account Holder, Admin, and Finance users letting them know that apps may be removed from the App Store in eligible countries or regions if payment is not received within the next 10 days.</p>
