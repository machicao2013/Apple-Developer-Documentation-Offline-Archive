<h1>Compliance review</h1>
<p>When you join the Apple Developer Program, Apple is obligated to verify the information you provide to ensure that neither you nor your organization are doing business in any embargoed countries, or listed on any restricted party lists published by governments.</p>
<p>There are different types of compliance reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Individual or user review:</b> Provide a valid government issued ID for the individual or user. You won't have access to any module in App Store Connect until the review is complete. <br/><p><b>Note: Please ensure that the name on your Apple Account matches the name on the ID provided.</b></p></li>
<li><b>Legal entity review:</b> Provide business registration or a certificate of incorporation document. You may not be able to sign pending agreements or submit new apps or app updates until review is complete.</li>
<li><b>Bank account review:</b> Provide a valid government issued ID for the Account Holder that matches the name on the bank account for individual accounts or a business registration or a certificate of incorporation document for company accounts. You may not be able to update your banking information or receive payments until review is complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Account Holder is responsible for submitting documentation for compliance reviews. Compliance reviews are standard for all Developer Program members and we aim to make these quick and efficient. To help streamline the review process, please ensure you're responding promptly to requests, using English (if available) for documents, and double-checking submissions. Please note that Apple periodically re-performs compliance reviews, including when you make changes to information related to your Developer Account. </p>
<p>You can track your compliance status in the Business module of App Store Connect. If your case is still pending after 14 business days, please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>
