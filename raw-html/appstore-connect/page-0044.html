<h3>Change iMessage app type</h3>
<div>
<p>If you want to change the type of iMessage app you offer, you may need to create and submit it as a new app. Currently, you can offer sticker packs or iMessage apps as either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Standalone apps</b>: the app is only accessible within iMessage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Extensions to iOS apps</b>: there's a containing iOS app with additional functionality outside of iMessage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can rebuild your standalone iMessage app as a standalone sticker pack and vice versa. Similarly, you can rebuild your iMessage extension as a sticker pack extension and vice versa. <a href="/help/app-store-connect/update-your-app/create-a-new-version">Submit these updates as version updates</a> to the same app record in App Store Connect. To rebuild your app from a standalone app to an extension of an iOS app or vice versa, you must <a href="/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-a-new-app">create it as a new app</a>.</p>
