<h1>Schedule price changes for apps</h1>
<p>If you’ve accepted the Paid Apps Agreement and submitted your app for review, you can schedule price changes for your app. Price changes can have definite start and end dates, or they can be permanent with no end. For example, you can set a promotional price for a month, then return to the regular price.</p>
