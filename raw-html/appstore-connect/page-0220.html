<h1>Set up promotional offers for auto-renewable subscriptions</h1>
<p>Apps on the App Store with auto-renewable subscriptions can provide a discounted price for a specific duration for existing and previously subscribed customers on iOS, macOS, and tvOS. You can use these offers to help win back subscribers who canceled their subscriptions or promote an upgrade to a higher-ranked subscription at a special price. Customers can accept the offer even if they've already accepted an introductory offer.</p>
<p>To get started, <a href="/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/generate-keys-for-in-app-purchases">generate keys for In-App Purchases</a>, create a promotional offer on your app's In-App Purchase page for each product, and choose a duration and offer type <a href="/help/app-store-connect/reference/pricing-and-availability/in-app-purchase-and-subscriptions-pricing-and-availability">(pay as you go, pay up front, free)</a>. You can have up to 10 active offers per subscription.</p>
<p>Once you've created offers in App Store Connect, use Xcode 10.2 or later to implement the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/implementing_subscription_offers_in_your_app">StoreKit APIs</a> to allow these offers to be accepted by customers running iOS 12.2, macOS 10.14.4, and tvOS 12.2, or later.</p>
