<h1>Set up OS data transfer</h1>
<p>OS data transfer allows users to seamlessly transfer your app’s data across Android and iOS by adding app IDs from your Android app in App Store Connect. During a data transfer, the user’s Android device will provide iOS a list of installed app IDs, which will be matched against what you have provided. This helps ensure that apps in the mapping table you provide are migrated.</p>
<p>In order to support this, you must provide your app information from Android so that we can correctly install your app. This includes your Android Package Name and the SHA-256 certificate fingerprint of your Signing Key Certificate.</p>
<p>You can also enable data migration by implementing <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appmigrationkit">AppMigrationKit</a>.</p>
<p>Each iOS app can only map to one Android app from Google Play; however, you can add up to 5 app ID mappings per app.</p>
<div class="callout callout-note">
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>Users can only use OS data transfer for your app if you set it up both in App Store Connect and with Google. Additionally, users must be running iOS 26.3 or later and a version of Android that also supports OS data transfer.</p>
