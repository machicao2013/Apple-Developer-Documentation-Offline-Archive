Transfer an app

# Accept an app transfer

You must accept the transfer within 60 days of its initiation.

**Required role: **Account Holder. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

1. Sign in to App Store Connect.

A notice indicates that an app is ready to be transferred.
2. Go to the Business section of App Store Connect. An app transfer alert will display in the Agreements section.
3. Under App Transfers on the right, click Review.
4. Enter the new metadata:

- Support URL
- Marketing URL (required if the app previously had a marketing URL)
- Privacy policy URL (required if the app previously had a privacy policy URL)
- App Review contact information
- App Store contact information
5. In the User Access section, indicate whether you want to give all users on your App Store Connect team access to the app or limit access to just Admin and Finance roles. Once the transfer is complete, you can limit access to specific people.
6. In the [App privacy section](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/manage-app-privacy), if the previous owner already disclosed what data the app collects and how it may be used, review the privacy details they entered by clicking View Existing Details. If you choose to delete the existing responses or if the previous owner of the app didn’t disclose what data the app collects and how it may be used, complete the [App privacy section](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/manage-app-privacy) before submitting a new app version.
7. Read the terms, select “I have read and agree to the agreement presented above,” then click Accept.

It can take up to two business days for the app transfer to complete, during which the [app status](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-and-submission-statuses) is Processing App Transfer.

If the app requires [export compliance documentation](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/overview-of-export-compliance), its status will be Waiting for Export Compliance until the appropriate documentation is reviewed by Apple. We’ll reach out to you directly to request documentation, or, alternatively, you may [contact us](https://developer.apple.com/contact/topic/SC1110/subtopic/30067/solution/select).

While the app is in this state, the transferor can’t edit the app metadata, rights, pricing, or In-App Purchases. Any open App Review communications are closed. If the app is part of a Game Center group, you can’t make changes to the group.

When the transfer is complete, both Account Holders are notified and the app no longer appears in the transferor’s App Store Connect account.

You can cancel an app transfer in [Business](https://www.apple.com/itunes/go/itunesconnect/contracts) while it's still in the Waiting for Recipient state. In the App Transfers section, click Review. Then, on the App Transfer page, click Decline. The transferor can also cancel the transfer.

**Note: **After an app transfer, you must create new provisioning profiles in the recipient's Apple Developer account. Ensure you associate these profiles with the transferred app's App ID and distribution certificate.

## add-a-new-app

Create an app record

# Add a new app

Before uploading a build of your app to App Store Connect, first create an app record in your App Store Connect account.

If you want to offer an app with multiple platforms as a single purchase, create it as a single record in App Store Connect. All platforms will share the same bundle ID, but you'll add [platform-specific information](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/platform-version-information) separately.

**Note: **You can't add an app to your account until the Account Holder signs the latest agreement in the Business section.

**Required role: **Account Holder, App Manager, or Admin. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

1. In Apps, click the add button (+) on the top left.

The Apps page is blank until you create your first app record.
2. In the pop-up menu, select New App.
3. In the New App dialog, select one or more platforms and enter the app information.

If you’re registered as a company, you have the option to [set your developer name.](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/set-your-developer-name)

**Note: **Watch-only apps are considered part of the iOS platform in App Store Connect.

![Screenshot of the new App dialog on App Store Connect. The Platforms field lists iOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS, which you can select for your app. The dialog also has fields for an app name, a primary language for the app, a bundle ID for the app, an SKU, and a radio button to choose whether to limit or give full user access. The Cancel and Create buttons are at the bottom of the dialog.](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-a-new-app/images/manage-apps-add-new-4_2x.png)
4. Under User Access, choose Limited Access or Full Access. If you select Limited Access, choose the users who should be able to access this app.

Users with the Account Holder, Admin, Finance, and Access to Reports roles can view all apps because these roles can't have their app access limited.
5. Click Create, and check for messages indicating any missing information.

After creating an App Store Connect record for an app, it appears in Apps, and its [status](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-and-submission-statuses) is Prepare for Submission. You can select the app on this page to [view and edit app information](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/view-and-edit-app-information).

### FAQs

### Can I deliver my app information using the App Store Connect REST API?

Yes, you can manage In-App Purchases, subscriptions, metadata, and app pricing via the [App Store Connect REST API](/app-store-connect/api/). This API simplifies customizing and automating your workflows.

### How do I offer an app that runs on multiple platforms as a single purchase?

You can [add a platform to an app](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-platforms) to create a universal purchase.

### What can I do if the app name I want to use on the App Store is unavailable?

You can use an app name for one app per localization.

If an app in your account already uses the app name, you have two options: submit an update to the existing app to change its name, or [remove the app](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/remove-an-app) from App Store Connect to allow the name to be used in a new app record.

If another developer is using the app name and you have trademark rights to it, you can [submit a claim](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/appnamenotices/).

# Add multiplayer compatibility

The Multiplayer Compatibility section of App Store Connect allows you to describe which versions of your Game Center-enabled apps can interact with each other during the matchmaking process. You can define the earliest multiplayer-compatible app version for iOS, macOS, and tvOS, and can even match games with different bundle identifiers against each other.

[Learn more about matchmaking.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/finding_multiple_players_for_a_game)

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, Developer, or Marketing. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Select the earliest compatible version of an app

## add-platforms

Create an app record

# Add platforms

You can add platforms to an app to create a universal purchase to let customers access your app and in‑app purchases across multiple platforms with a single purchase. For example, you can include the macOS, tvOS, and visionOS versions of your app within an existing iOS app. This distribution model lets customers obtain the iOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS together.

 Similar to creating a new version, a macOS, tvOS, visionOS app, or any combination of creating these platforms, uses the same Apple ID (an app identifier), SKU, and bundle ID as the iOS app.

**iPhone and iPad.**  To offer your app on iPhone and iPad, your app needs to support both devices.

**Apple Watch.** To offer your app on iPhone and Apple Watch, [create an iOS app in Xcode that includes a watchOS counterpart](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/setting_up_a_watchos_project). Upload both apps to App Store Connect from the same Xcode project. [Watch-only apps](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-apps/creating-independent-watchos-apps/#) can’t be part of a universal purchase. [Learn how to add watchOS app information.](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-watchos-app-information)

**Mac Catalyst.** Apps built with [Mac Catalyst](/mac-catalyst/) using [Xcode 11.4](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/) or later can share a bundle ID with the iOS version of the app, supporting universal purchase. You can’t add additional platform versions to apps built with Mac Catalyst using Xcode 11.3 or earlier on the Mac App Store.

**Apple Vision Pro.** You can't make apps that have been in the Kids category available on visionOS.

**Multiple app records.** If your app is currently available on multiple platforms through separate app records, note that you can't merge them. To offer universal purchase, remove all but one version from sale, and add the other versions to the remaining app's record. Once you remove an app from sale, you make its original product page on the App Store unavailable, you're no longer able to provide updates to existing users. Ratings and reviews are not transferred to the new product page.

When adding macOS, tvOS, visionOS, or any combination of these platforms, you must upload the builds for macOS, tvOS, and visionOS from a separate Xcode target. In the Xcode project, set the bundle IDs to match the iOS app's bundle ID. However, the apps for macOS, tvOS, and visionOS may each have different version numbers and build strings than the iOS app.

**Note: **Once App Store Review approves at least two platform versions, your app becomes available as a universal purchase. Once it’s a universal purchase, your app stays as universal purchase—not being able to remove a single platform version from the app record.

[Learn about adding a platform using App Store Connect API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/create_an_app_store_version)

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, or App Manager. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

# App and submission statuses

### App statuses

The *app status* indicates where an app is in the review and release process.

- A red status indicator (![](/help/images/icons/status-red-icon_2x.png)

) means that you need to perform an action before the app distributes.
- A yellow status indicator (![](/help/images/icons/status-yellow-icon_2x.png)

) means that a process, controlled either by you or Apple, is still happening.
- A green status indicator (![](/help/images/icons/status-green-icon_2x.png)

) means that the app is Ready for Distribution.

If an app status indicates as editable below, you can edit app metadata when the app has this status.

Receive automatic notifications to your web server whenever the status of your app changes by using webhooks. [Learn more](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/manage-webhooks).

## app-bundle-information

Reference

# App bundle information

*App bundle information* refers to the set of properties required to create an app bundle. Certain information pertains specifically to the app bundle, App Store Connect derives some from the first app you add to the bundle (the primary app), and other information comes from all the apps in the bundle.

## Bundle-specific information

This information is required for the primary language of the app bundle. Additional localizations are optional.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| App bundle name | The name of the app bundle as it appears on the App Store. |
| App bundle description | The descriptions of the app bundle as it appears on the App Store. |
| Marketing URL | This is optional. This can be the same URL as you use for the individual apps or a different one. |
| Price | The level that determines both the customer price and your proceeds.

The price tiers are broken down to Compatible Price Tiers and Incompatible Price Tiers. Compatible Price Tiers represent the price tiers that have met the minimum and maximum bundle pricing rules listed in App Bundle Availability and Price. Selecting one of these tiers can ensure that your app bundle can be made available on the App Store as long as all other requirements have been met.

Keep in mind that future price changes and intervals that have been set for your app could affect the list of compatible price tiers. |
| SKU | A unique ID for your bundle. The bundle SKU must be different from that of the SKU of the individual apps. You can use letters, numbers, hyphens, periods, and underscore. The SKU can't start with a hyphen, period, or underscore. |
| Cleared for Sale | Select Cleared for Sale to make your app bundle available on the App Store. There are no bundle-specific country or region settings. An app bundle will be live on the App Store only where all the member apps are available.

For example, if some of the apps in the bundle are cleared for sale worldwide but some are live only in specific countries or regions, the bundle will be available only in those countries or regions. You won't be able to select the Cleared for Sale checkbox if you already have ten app bundles cleared for sale. If you wish to clear a new app bundle for sale, you must first remove the Cleared for Sale check box from a different live bundle. |

## Primary app information

This information comes from the first app you add to a bundle. You don’t need to provide this information separately for the app bundle.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Category | The app bundle category will be derived from the primary app’s category. |
| Primary language | The primary localization is the primary language of the first app in the bundle.

Upon the initial creation of your app bundle, the bundle’s primary language will default to that of the primary app in the bundle. If another app is rearranged into the first position in the list of apps, it'll become the primary app, but the primary language won’t change. |
| Privacy policy | The privacy policy of your primary app will be used for the app bundle’s privacy policy. |
| License Agreement | If your primary app has a custom license agreement, it'll be used for the app bundle’s privacy policy. |
| Copyright | The app bundle copyright information will be derived from the primary app’s category. |
| Trade Representative Contact Information | If your primary app has a trade representative contact information, it'll be used for the app bundle’s privacy policy. |

## Bundle set information

This information comes from the first app you add to a bundle. You don’t need to provide this information separately for the app bundle.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Icon | The bundle icon consists of the icons for the first four apps in the bundle. |
| Screenshots | App bundles can display a maximum of ten screenshots, with an equal number of screenshots represented for each app. For example, if your app bundle contains five apps and each app has five screenshots, only two screenshots from each app will be displayed for your app bundle.

The order of the screenshots is based on the order of the apps in the bundle. The screenshots can be rearranged only as the apps in the bundle are rearranged. |
| App previews | Apps that have an app preview will always display it in place of the first screenshot. |
| Ratings | The rating is determined by the highest rating among the apps in the bundle. For example: if the bundle consists of an app with a 12+ rating and an app with a 9+ rating, the app bundle will have a rating of 12+. |
| Available localizations | Localizations will be derived from the common localizations across all of the apps. |
| Keywords | Each key word associated with the individual apps in the app bundle will be associated with the bundle. This isn't displayed on the bundle page in App Store Connect |
| Made for Kids | In order for an app bundle to be listed in the Made for Kids section on the App Store, all the apps in the bundle need to have the same age band. |

| Bundle ID | A unique identifier for your app that is used throughout the system. (A build is uniquely identified by the combination of the bundle ID, version number, and build string.) You can’t change this property after you [upload a build](/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/upload-builds).

**Important: **The Bundle ID property must match the bundle ID you [set in the Xcode project](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/deve21d0239c). |
| SKU | A unique ID you give to your app for internal tracking that's not visible to customers. The SKU can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, periods, and underscores but not start with a hyphen, period, or underscore. You can’t change the SKU after you [add the app to your account](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-a-new-app). |
| Apple ID | A unique identifier automatically generated for your app when you [add the app to your account](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-a-new-app). You can view this property in the App information section in App Store Connect. This identifier is also used in the URL for the App Store on desktop computers. You can’t edit this property. |
| Content Rights | Apps that contain, show, or access third-party content must have all the necessary rights to that content or be otherwise permitted to use it under the laws of each App Store country or region in which they’re available. [Learn more about the App Store guidelines](/app-store/review/guidelines/). |
| Age Rating | The age rating of your app for the purpose of parental controls. Note that the rating is set at the app level in the App information section and is applied across all platforms.

| Made for Kids | An indication that the app appears in the Kids category on the App Store. This property includes an age range set for the app. Once an app marked as Made for Kids is approved by App Review, this selection cannot be changed and all subsequent updates will need to follow the [Kids category guidelines](/app-store/review/guidelines/#kids-category). |
| License Agreement | Apple provides a standard EULA (End-User License Agreement) that applies in all regions. You may [provide a custom license agreement](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/provide-a-custom-license-agreement) that supersedes the Apple EULA for one or more regions. |
| Primary Language | The default language for the metadata that appears on App Store product pages, and is displayed when users install your app, when you don't provide localized metadata for a given country or region. [You can change the primary language at any time.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/localize-app-information#change-the-primary-language) |
| Category (Primary and Secondary) | The categories that best describe your app.

For macOS apps, you also [set the app category](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devcabdebc27) in Xcode. The primary category you set in App Store Connect should match the category you set in Xcode.

For more information, visit [Choosing a Category](/app-store/categories/). |
| Subcategory | If you select Games or Stickers as the Primary or Secondary Category, you can also select one or two subcategories to help more accurately define your game or stickers app. |
| Availability in the Republic of Korea - Rating Classification Number | If your app meets one or more of the following characteristics, a Rating Classification Number from the Game Rating and Administration Committee (GRAC) is required in order to offer it on the App Store in the Republic of Korea.

- App has been given the KR-19 regional rating by GRAC.
- Apps in the Casino subcategory with age rating 17+
- Apps in the Games or Entertainment categories with a Frequent/Intense level of frequency in at least one of the following content descriptions:

- Simulated Gambling
- Sexual Content or Nudity

| Availability in China mainland | Chinese law requires additional documentation for some apps to be available on the App Store in China mainland.

China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) requires that some apps possess a valid Internet Content Provider (ICP) Filing Number. The ICP number and metadata on the App Information page should match with the information you have filed with MIIT. This match is required for your Simplified Chinese localization; if not configured, then it should match your primary language. Once the provided ICP Filing Number is verified and saved, it will be displayed on your App Store product page.

In addition, games must secure an approval number and apps with books and magazine content must secure an internet publishing permit from China’s National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA). Apps with religious content must secure an Internet Religious Information Permit from China’s National Religious Affairs Administration (NRAA). Apps with news content must obtain an Internet News Information Permit from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). If you offer or plan to offer any of these on the App Store in China mainland, you must provide the required information along with one or more supporting documents.If applicable, provide the required ICP filing information in the designated section under the “App Information” tab. To help verify your approval number, upload your game’s ISBN Issuing Letter or Approval Reply, and a copy of your latest Business License. Additionally, you can include an authorization agreement from the matching operator. To help verify your publishing permit, upload your internet publishing permit or other relevant permit from the NPPA, a publishing permit authorization letter from the authorizing party, a business license, an ICP license, or similar supporting documentation. To help verify your Internet Religious Information Permit, upload your Internet Religious Information Permit, a permit authorization letter from the authorizing party, a business license, an ICP license, or similar supporting documentation. To help verify your Internet News Information Permit, upload your Internet News Information Permit, a permit authorization letter from the authorizing party, a business license, an ICP license, or similar supporting documentation.

# App Sandbox information

macOS

If you use App Sandbox entitlements, Apple needs information on each temporary exception entitlement included in the app. You add a temporary exception entitlement by editing the `.entitlements` property list file in the Xcode project. For more information, visit [App Sandbox Design Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011183).

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Entitlement Key | The entitlement key that corresponds to a temporary exception entitlement implemented in the app. |
| Usage Information | Information describing how to assess the entitlement and a description of the values in an array value used by the entitlement. If the entitlement works around a missing App Sandbox feature, file a bug report describing the exception using [Feedback Assistant](/bug-reporting/) and include the bug ID in the usage information.

The description should include:

- How the entitlement can be assessed
- Why the entitlement is needed by the app
- What functionality this entitlement enables
- If the entitlement uses an array value, provide information on each value in the array
- If the entitlement works around a missing App Sandbox feature, the ID of the bug you filed describing the exception |

## app-store-connect-workflow

Get started

# App Store Connect workflow

Use [App Store Connect](http://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) to submit apps for distribution, manage your apps, distribute beta versions using TestFlight,  accept legal agreements, enter tax and banking information, view trends and financial reports, and more. The [App Store Connect API](/app-store-connect/api/) is also available to automate your workflow.

Initially, only the Account Holder can sign in to App Store Connect using the Apple Account associated with their Apple Developer Program membership.

The Account Holder can invite additional users in the Users and Access section.

### Accept the agreement, and enter tax and banking information

If you want to sell your apps or offer In-App Purchases on the App Store, visit the Business section to sign the Paid Apps Agreement. Then, enter [banking](/help/app-store-connect/manage-banking-information/enter-banking-information) and [tax information](/help/app-store-connect/manage-tax-information/provide-tax-information).

### Add users and assign roles

To delegate responsibilities to others, visit the Users and Access section and [add users](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/add-and-edit-users) by entering their names and email addresses. They can then perform tasks based on the roles you assign them. [Learn about roles.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/overview-of-accounts-and-roles)

### Add your app and upload a build

In the Apps section, [create an app record](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-a-new-app) so your app’s information, such as name, keywords, and description, is ready for distribution. You don’t need to finish creating your app in Xcode before entering its information in App Store Connect. However, you must create an app record before you can upload a build of your app. You can [upload multiple builds](/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/upload-builds), and then view the builds and [variants](/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/view-builds-and-metadata) in App Store Connect.

### Test and submit your app

Distribute your app for testing using [TestFlight](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/testflight-overview), which supports apps for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS. You can [add internal testers](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/add-internal-testers) and [invite external testers](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/invite-external-testers) who'll use the TestFlight app to install your app on their devices. When your app is ready for distribution, [choose the build you want to submit](/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/choose-a-build-to-submit) and [send it to App Review](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/overview-of-submitting-for-review). You can continue improving your app by [creating new versions](/help/app-store-connect/update-your-app/create-a-new-version) periodically.

### Monitor your apps status, usage, and sales

You can [monitor the status of your app](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/view-app-status-history) as it goes through App Review. Once it’s live on the App Store, you can gain insights on its performance through [App Analytics, Sales and Trends, and Payments and Financial Reports](/help/app-store-connect/measure-app-performance/overview-of-reporting-tools), and [respond to user reviews](/help/app-store-connect/monitor-ratings-and-reviews/respond-to-reviews) on the App Store. App Store Connect for iPhone and iPad also lets you view some of this information and perform other tasks.

# App Store pricing and availability start times by country or region

When you modify information aspects of your app, the dates and times these changes take effect on the App Store vary by country or region. This includes changes such as setting the availability of apps, In-App Purchases, and pre-orders, scheduling introductory and win-back offers, or adjusting prices.

- Times listed in the table below adjust automatically for US daylight saving time observance. During this period, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) release times move one hour earlier and reflect accurately for your selected date.
- If you schedule a price change in App Store Connect for a date and time that has already passed in some countries or regions, the change takes effect immediately but may require up to 24 hours to display for all users.

 View release times based on your scheduled date in App Store Connect. Times are shown for the timezone of your browser, as well as UTC.

## apple-hosted-asset-pack-size-limits

Reference

# Apple-hosted asset pack size limits

There are limits on the amount of storage used by Apple-hosted asset packs when you upload to App Store Connect. The table below outlines the different size limits for these asset packs. These limits are shared across all platforms offered for your app.

You can make additional space available by archiving asset packs. This removes all versions of an asset pack from App Store Connect, including those being tested in TestFlight and live on the App Store. [Learn more.](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/test-apple-hosted-asset-packs#archive-asset-packs)

| Item | Size limit description | Size limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Asset pack total | The total sum of size usage for all asset packs uploaded to an app record in App Store Connect.

For each asset pack in App Store Connect, Apple calculates the maximum size over all versions that are eligible to be tested in TestFlight or submitted for App Store distribution. This calculation doesn’t include versions that have the Awaiting Upload, Processing, or Failed TestFlight status, nor those that have the Superseded status for both TestFlight and the App Store. Then, the maximum size of each asset pack is added together to reach the *asset pack total*.

For example, AssetPackID1 has two versions: version 1 is 4 GB, and version 2 is 2 GB. AssetPackID2 has one version: version 1 is 1 GB. The asset pack total for this app is 5 GB, since the maximum size for AssetPackID1 is 4 GB and the maximum size for AssetPackID2 is 1 GB.

If you upload a new asset pack version and reach 80% or more of the asset pack total limit, you'll be notified via email. A banner will also display on the asset pack page in the TestFlight section of App Store Connect. | 200 GB |
| Asset pack count | The total number of asset packs that are allowed to be uploaded to an app record in App Store Connect. | 100 |

# Apple-hosted asset pack statuses

The *asset pack* status tells you immediately whether your asset pack version needs attention. The status applies only to the version of an asset pack, not the entire app or asset pack.

- A red status indicator (![](/help/images/icons/status-red-icon_2x.png)

) means that you need to perform some action.
- A yellow status indicator (![](/help/images/icons/status-yellow-icon_2x.png)

) means that some process is ongoing, controlled either by you or by Apple.
- A green status indicator (![](/help/images/icons/status-green-icon_2x.png)

) means the asset pack is ready to be tested in TestFlight or live on the App Store.

### TestFlight statuses

You can view the TestFlight status of an asset pack version [under the TestFlight tab in App Store Connect](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/test-apple-hosted-asset-packs) and in the Asset Packs section under General on the Distribution tab.

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Awaiting Upload | You've created a new asset pack version using the App Store Connect API but haven't uploaded it yet.

If you're using Transporter, iTMSTransporter, or altool, new asset pack versions are automatically created when you upload an asset pack, so the Processing status will likely display instead. If you've uploaded a version using these tools and it's stuck in the Awaiting Upload status for more than 24 hours, [contact us](https://developer.apple.com/contact/). |
| ![](/help/images/icons/status-yellow-icon_2x.png)

 Processing | Your asset pack version is still being processed. You'll receive an email notification when the version is ready.

If you upload an asset pack and it remains in the Processing status for more than 24 hours, there may be an issue. To resolve the issue, [contact us](https://developer.apple.com/contact/). |
| ![](/help/images/icons/status-red-icon_2x.png)

 Failed | Apple received your asset pack version, but it has one or more issues and can't be tested. You'll receive an email with more details about why the delivery failed. Resolve any issues, then redeliver the asset pack. |
| ![](/help/images/icons/status-green-icon_2x.png)

 Ready for Internal Testing | Your asset pack version is ready to be tested internally. TestFlight will automatically use this asset pack version for internal testing once you've invited testers and have a build available for testing. |
| Ready to Submit | You've uploaded an asset pack version to App Store Connect but haven't submitted it to TestFlight App Review. |
| ![](/help/images/icons/status-yellow-icon_2x.png)

 Waiting for Review | Your asset pack version has been submitted to TestFlight App Review for external testing. It'll need to be approved before it can be tested externally. |
| ![](/help/images/icons/status-yellow-icon_2x.png)

 In Review | Your asset pack version is currently being reviewed by TestFlight App Review for external testing. It'll need to be approved before it can be tested externally. |
| ![](/help/images/icons/status-red-icon_2x.png)

 Rejected | Your asset pack version was rejected by TestFlight App Review and can no longer be tested externally. To begin external testing, upload a new version and submit it to TestFlight App Review. |
| ![](/help/images/icons/status-green-icon_2x.png)

 Ready for External Testing | Your asset pack version is ready to be tested externally. TestFlight will automatically use this version for external testing once you've invited testers and have a build available for testing. |
| Superseded | A new asset pack version is being tested internally and externally in TestFlight so this version is no longer in use. |

### App Store statuses

You can view the App Store status of an asset pack version in the Asset Packs section under General on the Distribution tab.

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Prepare for Submission | You've uploaded an asset pack version to App Store Connect but haven't submitted it to App Review. |
| ![](/help/images/icons/status-yellow-icon_2x.png)

 Ready for Review | Your asset pack version has been added to a submission, but it hasn’t been submitted to App Review. |
| ![](/help/images/icons/status-yellow-icon_2x.png)

 Waiting for Review | Apple received your submission, but hasn’t started the review. |
| ![](/help/images/icons/status-yellow-icon_2x.png)

 In Review | App Review is reviewing your asset pack version. You can [cancel the submission](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/remove-a-submission-from-review) to remove it from review. |
| ![](/help/images/icons/status-yellow-icon_2x.png)

 Accepted | Your asset pack version has been accepted, but there are one or more rejected items in the submission. All items in the submission must be accepted before any can be published.

You can edit the rejected items and resubmit, or you can remove them from the submission.

[Learn how to reply to App Review messages.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/reply-to-app-review-messages) |
| ![](/help/images/icons/status-red-icon_2x.png)

 Rejected | App Review didn’t accept your asset pack version. You can [edit the asset pack and resubmit](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/manage-a-submission-with-unresolved-issues#edit-and-resubmit-rejected-items). Alternatively, you can [remove the asset pack from the submission](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/manage-a-submission-with-unresolved-issues#remove-rejected-items) or [cancel the submission](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/remove-a-submission-from-review), which will move it back to the Prepare for Submission status. |
| ![](/help/images/icons/status-green-icon_2x.png)

 Processing for Distribution | Your asset pack version is processing and will be ready for distribution within 24 hours. |
| ![](/help/images/icons/status-yellow-icon_2x.png)

# Audio Descriptions evaluation criteria

iOS
macOS
tvOS
visionOS
watchOS

### Description

Audio descriptions are additional dialogue, interspersed between natural pauses in the main audio of a program or interstitial content, that describe to viewers who are blind or low vision what’s happening on-screen during time-based visual content.

### Goals

Everyone should be able to use your app, regardless of whether they have a disability. The goal of the Audio Descriptions feature is to support users who are blind or have low vision. Predominantly used in movies and TV shows, audio descriptions (AD) combine the main audio track with additional narration describing inaudible on-screen events. For example, “Mark stares at Gemma through the window. His expression displays inner conflict, as he wonders what to do next.”

![Screen shot of Apple TV app for Mac, displaying a scene from Severance with two characters running down a hallway. The audio track selection menu is open, with “Original: English AD” selected.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/audio-descriptions-evaluation-criteria/images/audio-descriptions_2x.png)

When an AD audio track is selected, narration describes for the scene above from Severance as: “In slow motion, Mark and Helly run together down a long white hallway flashing with red light.”

The following sections provide more detail about how to determine whether your app supports Audio Descriptions well. The goal is to help ensure users with disabilities can leverage all common tasks of the app, therefore performing this evaluation will help you determine whether to indicate your app **Supports Audio Descriptions** on the App Store.

### Getting started with testing

While you’re not required to use Apple frameworks to indicate support for Audio Descriptions, your app should still enable audio descriptions by default when detecting the systemwide audio descriptions setting. If you offer your own in-app setting, it should either support similar functionality to the systemwide setting, or offer more granular user interface customization.

Review the resources below to learn how to enable audio descriptions for each device your app supports.

- For iPhone, visit [Hear audio descriptions for video content on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph4768b3f5c).
- For iPad, visit [Hear audio descriptions for video content on iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipadb6108e6b).
- For Mac, visit [Change Audio Descriptions settings for accessibility on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchl2a14f1c5).
- For Apple TV, visit [Use audio descriptions on Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/atvb372a82a4).
- For Apple Vision Pro, visit [Hear audio descriptions for video content on Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/tan7daefbf61).

## Indicating support for Audio Descriptions

You may say that your app supports Audio Descriptions if it provides narrated descriptions of relevant on-screen content for video played in your app, including game interstitials and audible dialogue. 

- Even if your app doesn’t include movies or TV shows, there may be other areas where your app presents on-screen time-based content that may not be available through another form of sensory perception. For example, opening sequences, game interstitials, and cut scenes should be described, even if they’re not delivered in a standard video player. You should also describe tips and hints that are otherwise only available through visual clues.
- As one uncommon but creative example, a video streaming service might choose to provide an audio-only watchOS app, and automatically select the audio description track.

**Audio Descriptions in third-party content**

If your app presents third-party content, such as video posts in a social media app, videos added by the user in a presentation app, or TV or movie streaming in an entertainment app, users should have the ability to include an audio description track for your app to present. To indicate support for Audio Descriptions, you’re ***not*** responsible for ensuring every piece of third-party media has audio descriptions. However, you should ensure the following:

- Users should be able to determine which pieces of media content are audio described. For example, most video streaming service apps will present an “AD” icon on videos that include audio descriptions.
- If your app includes the functionality to select audio descriptions, but very little or no described content is available on your app, don’t indicate support for Audio Descriptions.
- Consider evangelizing audio descriptions to your content providers so more video content has audio descriptions.

## Additional suggestions

- Creating great audio description content is a creative process that many movie and TV production teams have started to author and record in-house. Others contract this work to external service firms that specialize in audio description, captioning, and other types of accessible media.
- If you or your content partners will be developing the audio descriptions yourself, try watching one of your favorite movies or shows with audio descriptions enabled. Pay attention to the details, like the tone of voice, and terseness that is necessary in some scenes. Pay attention to the detail provided in scenarios like end credits. Apple TV+ provides audio description content in multiple languages, and most other major streaming services provide audio description content as well.

Even after you’re able to indicate support for Audio Descriptions in the common tasks of your app, there are likely further improvements you’ll be able to make to the accessibility of your app. Re-evaluate your app’s support for Audio Descriptions every time you update your app. Set a goal to make your app more accessible to more people in every release.

Reference

# Auto-renewable subscription information

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Subscription Group | A set of subscription products with varying levels and durations. Users can subscribe to one subscription product per group at a time. |
| Subscription Group Reference Name | An internal name you choose for a subscription group. This name will only appear on App Store Connect and in Sales and Trends reports, and won’t be visible to users. |
| Subscription Group Display Name | A user-facing name you choose for a subscription group. This is the name that appears on the App Store, and it can be localized. Subscription group display names must not contain control characters (for example, null, new lines, carriage returns, escape, and other invisible characters), or markup language (for example, HTML tags, or Unicode characters, such as emoticons, diacritics, or special characters). |
| App Name Display Options | A set of options that let you choose between using your app’s name or providing a custom name to display above the Subscription Group Display Name on the Manage Subscriptions page on user devices. |
| Auto-Renewable Subscription | A product that allows users to purchase dynamic content for a set period. This type of subscription renews automatically unless cancelled by the user. Subscription duration and price is configured in App Store Connect. |
| Auto-Renewable Subscription Levels | A ranking system of subscriptions within a subscription group that determines the upgrade, downgrade, and crossgrade path available to subscribers. Levels make it possible to offer varying access (basic, premium) of the same service. If you offer only one subscription product in your app, the subscription defaults to a single level within the subscription group.

If you have multiple subscription products, arrange them in order from the one that offers the most (level 1) to the one that offers the least. You can stack subscriptions with equal content but different durations and other similar variables at the same level. Each level can have multiple subscription products, allowing for multiple durations and prices for people to choose from. This lets them upgrade, downgrade, and crossgrade within the subscription group without impacting their days of paid service. |
| Upgrade | When someone switches to a subscription that you’ve ranked at a higher level. The customer’s prorated payment from lower level subscription is refunded to the original payment method. They’re charged for the higher level subscription, which goes into effect immediately. The date of upgrade is the renewal date for the higher level subscription. |
| Downgrade | When someone switches to a subscription that you’ve ranked at a lower level. They’re charged for the lower level subscription on their next renewal date. |
| Crossgrade | When someone switches between subscriptions that you’ve ranked at the same level. If the subscriptions are different durations, the crossgrade goes into effect on the customer’s next renewal date. If the subscriptions are the same duration, the customer’s prorated payment from the previous subscription is refunded to the original payment method. Then they’re charged for the new subscription, which goes into effect immediately. The date of cross grade is the renewal date for the new subscription. |
| Auto-Renewable Subscription Duration | The length of time before the subscription renews and the subscriber is charged. Possible durations are 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The duration can’t be changed after you submit for review.

Auto-renewable subscriptions renew on the same day as the calendar date of the original purchase. If a one month free trial starts on January 7, the trial ends on February 7. If a one-month duration starts on a date that doesn’t occur in the next month, the trial ends on the last day of the next month, and reverts to the original date the next time that date occurs. For example, if someone subscribes on January 30, the next renewal date is February 28 (or February 29 in a leap year), and then March 30. |
| Auto-Renewable Subscription Display Name | A user-facing name you choose for a subscription. This is the name that appears on the App Store, and it can be localized. Subscription display names must not contain control characters (for example, null, new lines, carriage returns, escape, and other invisible characters), or markup language (for example, HTML tags, or Unicode characters, such as emoticons, diacritics, or special characters). |

# Auto-renewable subscription price increase thresholds

Increases in auto-renewable subscription prices that exceed the below thresholds in each App Store country or region result in a request for subscribers to consent to the new price.

Whether the threshold is exceeded for a subscriber and consent is required depends on whether the threshold is exceeded when the renewal occurs. These thresholds are subject to change based on changes in tax or foreign exchange rates.

# Captions evaluation criteria

iOS
macOS
tvOS
visionOS
watchOS

### Description

Captions are usually time-synchronized text alternatives for dialogue and relevant sounds in videos or some forms of audio-only content. Captions are an accommodation for the Deaf and hard of hearing communities, but captions are also used widely by those without hearing loss.

### Goals

Everyone should be able to use your app, regardless of whether they have a disability. The goal of the Captions feature is to support users whose system settings express a need or desire to have audible dialogue and other sounds visibly rendered on screen, or to an alternate output device like a tactile braille display. Captions are a critical accommodation for the Deaf, DeafBlind, and hard of hearing communities, but captions are also used widely by those without hearing loss.

![Screen shot of Apple TV app for Mac, displaying a scene with four characters sitting in a small room with red and blue lights, discussing intensely. Subtitles read: Cobel’s gone. Milchick’s in charge.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/captions-evaluation-criteria/images/captions_2x.png)

The following sections provide more detail about how to determine whether your app supports Captions well. The goal is to help ensure users with disabilities can leverage all common tasks of the app, therefore performing this evaluation will help you determine whether to indicate your app **Supports Captions** on the App Store.

### Getting started with testing

While you’re not required to use Apple frameworks to indicate support for Captions, your app should still enable captions by default when detecting the systemwide captions setting. If you offer your own in-app setting, it should either support similar functionality to the systemwide setting, or offer more granular user interface customization.

Review the resources below to learn how to turn on systemwide captions for each device your app supports.

- For iPhone, visit [Display subtitles and captions on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph3e2e23d1).
- For iPad, visit [Display subtitles and captions on iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad9a246b38).
- For Mac, visit [Use subtitles and closed captions on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchlc1cb8d54).
- For Apple TV, visit [Turn on closed captions and SDH](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/atvb1d61ca06).
- For Apple Vision Pro, visit [Display subtitles and captions on Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/tan0201bdfb1).

## Indicating support for Captions

You may say that your app supports Captions if it provides captions for video played through your app, including game interstitials and audible dialogue. You may also indicate support for Captions if your app provides text transcripts of audio-only content, such as music lyrics or spoken dialogue in podcasts.

- For video content, you may indicate support for Captions if your app has dialogue-only subtitles for primary and alternate languages, but consider improving your pipeline to offer closed captions or SDH, which also includes relevant non-verbal audio such as “[doorbell rings]” or “[dog barks].”
- Even if your app doesn’t include movies or TV shows with typical subtitles or closed captions, there may be other areas where your app presents spoken dialogue or other relevant sounds. Game interstitials, for example, often include dialogue that should be captioned, even though it’s not delivered with standard captions in a standard video player.
- If your app provides verbal audio content, such as music with lyrics or spoken podcasts, consider providing a text copy of that content as a transcript. Text transcripts don’t need to be time-synchronized, and you may indicate support for Captions based on the inclusion of high quality transcripts. For example, even though watchOS apps don’t support video playback, a watchOS app could include music lyrics or a transcript for spoken audio.

**Captions in third-party content**

If your app presents third-party video content, such as video posts in a social media app, videos added by the user in a presentation app, or TV or movie streaming in an entertainment app, users should have the ability to include caption data for your app to present. To indicate support for Captions, you’re ***not*** responsible for ensuring every piece of third-party media has captions. However, you should ensure the following:

- Users should be able to determine which pieces of media content are captioned. For example, most video streaming service apps will present a “CC” or “SDH” icon on videos that include captions, along with other details about available subtitle languages.
- If your app includes the functionality to display captions, but very little or no captioned content is available on your app, don’t indicate support for Captions.
- Consider evangelizing captions to your content providers so more video content has captions.

Even after you’re able to indicate support for Captions in the common tasks of your app, there are likely further improvements you’ll be able to make to the accessibility of your app. Re-evaluate your app’s support for Captions every time you update your app. Set a goal to make your app more accessible to more people in every release.

## compliance-review

Reference

# Compliance review

When you join the Apple Developer Program, Apple is obligated to verify the information you provide to ensure that neither you nor your organization are doing business in any embargoed countries, or listed on any restricted party lists published by governments.

There are different types of compliance reviews:

- **Individual or user review:** Provide a valid government issued ID for the individual or user. You won't have access to any module in App Store Connect until the review is complete. 
**Note: Please ensure that the name on your Apple Account matches the name on the ID provided.**
- **Legal entity review:** Provide business registration or a certificate of incorporation document. You may not be able to sign pending agreements or submit new apps or app updates until review is complete.
- **Bank account review:** Provide a valid government issued ID for the Account Holder that matches the name on the bank account for individual accounts or a business registration or a certificate of incorporation document for company accounts. You may not be able to update your banking information or receive payments until review is complete.

The Account Holder is responsible for submitting documentation for compliance reviews. Compliance reviews are standard for all Developer Program members and we aim to make these quick and efficient. To help streamline the review process, please ensure you're responding promptly to requests, using English (if available) for documents, and double-checking submissions. Please note that Apple periodically re-performs compliance reviews, including when you make changes to information related to your Developer Account. 

You can track your compliance status in the Business module of App Store Connect. If your case is still pending after 14 business days, please [contact us](/contact/).

## configure-multiple-product-page-versions

Create custom product pages

# Configure multiple product page versions

Create up to 70 custom product pages per app on the App Store to highlight features or specific content. Each custom product page can include different screenshots, previews, promotional text, and keywords, and is localizable and shareable through a unique URL.

Custom product pages must be approved before they are visible to users. [Learn how to submit a custom product page.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-a-custom-product-page)

Custom product pages are available on the App Store on iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, or later. Custom product pages are only visible to people if they follow a custom product page link, or if you choose to make your custom product page visible in App Store search results by adding keywords. Otherwise, your app’s default product page displays to all customers on the App Store.

In App Analytics, view App Store metrics such as impressions, downloads, and conversion rate for each page. The metrics are available after a custom product page receives at least five first-time downloads. [Learn more about data in App Analytics.](/help/app-store-connect/view-app-analytics/view-app-metrics)

You can optionally add an app deep link to your custom product page. When users running a minimum of iOS 18 or iPadOS 18 click Open on your custom product page, the app deep link directs them to specific content in your app.

- An app deep link can be a universal link or custom URL. Use universal links for app deep links to provide users with a secure and integrated mobile experience. [Learn about configuring universal links.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content)
- Avoid using URL shorteners and other services that add unnecessary redirects.
- Test the deep link to ensure it directs to the proper destination within your app — for example, you can paste your URL into the Notes app and tap it.
- Your app deep link must be approved before it'll function for users. Submit your custom product page for review after you add a deep link in App Store Connect.

[Learn how to create and manage a custom product page using the App Store Connect API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/app_store/custom_product_pages_and_localizations)

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, or Marketing. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Create a custom product page

You can create a custom product page if your app has the Ready for Distribution status in at least one country or region.

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the left sidebar, click Custom Product Pages.
3. Click Create Custom Product Page.

If there’s an existing custom product page, click add button (+).
4. Enter a reference name to help you identify the page in App Analytics.
5. Choose whether to start with a blank page or make changes to an existing App Store product page. If you choose to start from an existing page, you can choose a version that’s in the Ready for Distribution state or the Prepare for Submission state and it’ll copy the product page for your primary localization.
6. Click Create. Your custom product page’s unique URL is automatically generated and displays on this page.
7. Modify or add additional screenshots, app previews, promotional text, or keywords.

You can optionally add an app deep link to direct users running a minimum of iOS 18 or iPadOS 18 to specific content in your app.

### Enable keywords for a custom product page

You can assign keywords from your latest approved app version to a custom product page. This directs customers to your custom product page when they search those keywords, rather than your default product page. You can assign keywords in App Store Connect at any time, but the custom product page is searchable only after it’s approved and set to visible.

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the left sidebar, click Custom Product Pages.
3. Click the custom product page you want to assign keywords to.
4. In the Keywords section, select the keywords for this custom product page.

Repeat this as necessary for each localization.
5. Click Publish.

### Edit a custom product page

An approved custom product page can be edited and submitted for review without affecting its unique URL. Changes are published automatically upon approval by App Review.

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the left sidebar, click Custom Product Pages.
3. Click the page you want to edit.
4. Click Edit.
5. Review the prompt and click Edit again to proceed. This creates a new draft of your custom product page in the Ready to Submit state.
6. Make your edits and click Add for Review.

The submission confirmation screen displays the app version that’ll be associated with the custom product page, and the items that’ll be reviewed. You may choose to add other items to the submission.
7. Click Submit to App Review.

Once the edited page is approved, it will replace the current page on the App Store.

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the left sidebar, click Custom Product Pages.
3. Click the page you want to disable.
4. Under the Product Page URL, click Disable Link.

For a disabled link, Enable Link will display instead.
5. Click Disable.

### Delete a custom product page

You can delete a custom product page at any time. If someone selects a URL for a deleted custom product page, they’re automatically redirected to your default product page. This action is permanent.

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the left sidebar, click Custom Product Pages.
3. Click the page you want to delete.
4. Scroll to the bottom and click Delete This Product Page.

## configure-test-treatments

Create product page optimization tests

# Configure test treatments

By default, test treatments are copies of your app’s original App Store product page. You can edit the app icon, screenshots, and previews of each treatment. If you choose not to edit one of these items, the metadata from your original product page will display for that item.

Before testing, ensure all metadata in your test treatments is approved. You can submit this metadata without submitting a new version of your app. However, any app icons you wish to use must be part of the app binary for the current App Store version, which should be built with Xcode 13 or later and support alternate icons in asset catalogs through an appropriate SDK.

If you’re simply changing the order of screenshots or previews that are already on the App Store, or only modifying the app icon, your metadata is already approved and you don’t need to resubmit.

**Note: **Product page optimization tests aren't available for [custom product pages](/help/app-store-connect/create-custom-product-pages/configure-multiple-product-page-versions) or for product pages on the App Store for Apple Watch or iMessage.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, or Marketing. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the left sidebar, click Product page optimization.
3. The default treatment names are Treatment A, Treatment B, and Treatment C. Treatment names are only visible to you in App Store Connect and help you identify treatments in App Analytics. Next to the treatment name you want to edit, click Edit Name.
4. Enter a treatment name, then click OK.
5. Click the App Icon tab, which displays if your app binary includes more than one icon. Ensure any icons you want to use are part of the app binary currently on the App Store. This app version must be built with an SDK that supports alternate icons in asset catalogs. Icons must also be sized to 1024x1024 pixels.
6. Click Change under under the icon of the treatment you want to change.
7. Choose an icon from the menu that appears. This menu shows all app icons included in your app’s binary. If an app is downloaded from a product page with a test treatment, the test treatment app icon displays throughout the download process and on the user’s device.
8. Click the device tabs and add screenshots and previews. If you choose not to edit screenshots or previews for a certain device size, the treatment will use the ones on your original product page for that device size. For details on specifications, visit [Screenshot specifications](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/screenshot-specifications) and [App preview specifications](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-preview-specifications).

## consent-for-subscription-offer-conversions

Reference

# Consent for subscription offer conversions

In certain countries or regions, the App Store requires that you obtain customer consent when converting from subscription offers to standard paid subscriptions. Each storefront may enforce different consent policies and as a result, the App Store experience may vary based on storefront. See below for country-specific consent experiences.

### Republic of Korea

For customers converting from introductory or subscription offers in the Republic of Korea, Apple collects consent through email, in-app sheets, or push notifications. The timing and frequency of these communications may differ from those shown for [standard subscription price increases](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/manage-pricing-for-auto-renewable-subscriptions).

[Learn about consent requirements in the Republic of Korea.](https://www.ftc.go.kr/www/selectBbsNttList.do?bordCd=3&key=12&searchCtgry=01,02)

### Messaging cadence

| Offer duration | Consent window starts | Messaging cadence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 days | 24 hours after offer redemption | No follow up |
| 7 day | 24 hours after offer redemption | 3 days from renewal date: push notification, email, in-app sheet. |
| 2 weeks | 24 hours after offer redemption | Every 7 days: push notification, email, in-app sheet. |
| 1 month | 24 hours after offer redemption | Every 7 days: push notification, email, in-app sheet. |
| Longer than 1 month | 30 days prior to renewal date | Every 7 days: push notification, email, in-app sheet. |

## core-technology-fee-overview

Understanding the Core Technology Fee

# Core Technology Fee overview

The Core Technology Fee (CTF) is an element of the business terms in the European Union (EU) if a developer chooses to adopt the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU. The fee reflects the value Apple provides developers through ongoing investments in the tools, technologies, and services that enable them to build and share innovative apps with users.

Developers operating under the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU have the option to distribute their iOS and iPadOS apps in the EU via the App Store, Web Distribution, and/or alternative app marketplaces. They can also use alternative payment processors in their apps in the EU on the App Store across Apple operating systems. The CTF only applies to apps downloaded by EU users on devices running minimum of iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 18.

**The CTF aims to meet the needs of both users and developers.** Since a first annual install is only counted once per account, developers can deliver unlimited feature updates, bug fixes, and security patches to users for 12 months with no additional fee, regardless of how many devices the user has. And when users upgrade or replace their devices, developers aren’t charged when users reinstall their apps through an [iCloud transfer](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108344).

[Learn more about the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/download/alternate_eu_terms_addendum.pdf)

### How the fee works

The CTF is based on the number of first annual installs for an app in a 12-month period.

- **First annual install.** This is the first time an app is installed by an account in the EU in a 12-month period. After each first annual install, the app may be installed any number of times by the same account for the next 12 months with no additional charge. A first annual install may result from an app’s first-time install, a reinstall, or an update from any iOS and/or iPadOS app distributed through the App Store, an alternative app marketplace, your website, TestFlight, an App Clip, volume purchases via Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager, and/or as a custom app.
- **One million free first annual installs.** Membership in the Apple Developer Program includes one million first annual installs per year for free for apps distributed from the App Store, Web Distribution, and/or alternative marketplaces.
- **Fee for each first annual install over one million.** Developers pay a CTF of €0.50 for each first annual install over one million in the past 12 months.

**Apple provides many conditions where developers do not pay the CTF:**

- Developers whose apps do not surpass one million [first annual installs](/help/app-store-connect/understanding-the-core-technology-fee/measure-your-first-annual-installs/) per year.
- Nonprofit organizations, accredited educational institutions, or government entities with an [Apple Developer Program fee waiver](https://developer.apple.com/support/fee-waiver/).
- Developers that earn no revenue whatsoever. This includes offering a free app without monetization of any kind (physical, digital, advertising, or otherwise). This is intended to give students, hobbyists, and other non-commercial developers an opportunity to create a popular app without paying the CTF.

**To support small developers, we provide a 3-year on-ramp to the CTF to help them create innovative apps and rapidly grow their business:**

- Small developers (earning less than €10 million in global business revenue) who haven’t previously exceeded one million first annual installs are provided with a 3-year free on-ramp to the CTF. During this period that starts once a developer signs the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU, they won't pay the CTF for first annual installs that exceed the threshold so long as they continue to earn less than €10 million in global business revenue within the 3 years.
- If a small developer grows to earn between €10 million and €50 million global annual business revenue within this 3-year on-ramp period, they’ll start to pay the CTF after one million first annual installs up to a cap of €1 million per year. After 3 years, they will pay for each first annual install after the initial one million first annual installs per year.
- To qualify for these terms for up to 3 continuous years, developers must declare their global business revenue is in an eligible tier annually. After 3 years, they will pay for each first annual install after the initial one million first annual installs per year.

### First annual installs

The first annual install of an app takes place the first time it’s installed on iOS and/or iPadOS by an Apple account in the EU in a 12-month period. Each first annual install initiates a 12-month period of unlimited installs for that app by the same account at no additional charge. Once the period ends, the next install counts as a first annual install and starts a new 12-month period of unlimited installs for that app by the same account. Each first annual install is attributed to a particular month, regardless of the day it occurs. For example, since first annual installs occurring on May 1 and May 15 both take place in May, their 12-month period ends on April 30 of the following year.

Apple only counts first annual installs of an app that occur after the developer adopts the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU. Under these terms, developers can continue to deliver app updates as needed throughout the year and users can continue to receive essential updates, as well as new features and improvements that provide the best experience.

Only certain kinds of installs can be considered a first annual install, such as the first time an iOS and/or iPadOS app is ever installed, redownloads of an app that was previously installed, and app updates, as long as they start a new 12-month period. Users who install the same app on both iOS and iPadOS within a 12-month period will only generate one first annual install for that app. Other installs, such as reinstalls of offloaded apps, iCloud transfers, and auto-downloads onto additional devices by the same Apple Account in the EU are not considered first annual installs. Learn about what can be considered a first annual install.

For example, let’s say that in April 2024, an Apple account in the EU installs Forest Explorer for the very first time on iOS. This is considered a first annual install and it starts a 12-month period when the developer can deliver an unlimited number of installs of that app to that account without generating an additional first annual install. Once the 12-month period ends, the next install counts as a first annual install and starts another 12-month period of unlimited installs for that app and account.

![Diagram visually representing First Annual Installs for a fictional application called Forest Explorer.](/support/images/core-technology-fee/example_2x.png)

Apple has designed app installation capabilities for developers that align with our strong stance on privacy, ensuring that individual user data is protected and that app installation data is not shared with developers in a way that can identify individual users. Information about an app’s first annual installs is also not shared with other developers.

### Taxation, billing, and payments

As is standard for business transactions, the Core Technology Fee does not include taxes. You may see any applicable taxes, as required by tax law, added as new lines on your invoice. Taxes may apply in certain countries and/or regions, including but not limited to, value-added tax (VAT), sales and use tax, goods and services tax (GST), and consumption tax. For details, view the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU.

Generally, the applicability of tax depends on a combination of factors:

- Your business location (your legal entity address provided when enrolling in the Apple Developer Program).
- Tax information that you provide to Apple (such as valid tax ID, exemption status, etc.).
- The billing Apple legal entity.

If you have questions, consult your tax adviser.

Developers who owe a Core Technology Fee in a given month will receive an invoice by the 15th day of the following month and will need to provide payment within 30 days of receiving the invoice. You can pay directly from your bank using a unique, virtual routing number for your developer account that’s provided on the invoice. Please note that late payments accrue interest and nonpayment may result in the offset of App Store In-App Purchase proceeds owed to you, removal of the app from the App Store, or removal from the Apple Developer Program.

### Declaring your revenue as a small developer

We strongly recommend that small developers declare their revenue, even if none of their apps are above one million first annual installs, so that they can receive the appropriate benefits if any of their apps later exceed that threshold. If any of your apps exceed one million first annual installs before you declare your revenue, then you will not be eligible for the on-ramp benefits.

To declare your revenue, the Account Holder of your Apple Developer Program membership can select their global annual revenue category when agreeing to the [Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/alternative-eu-terms-addendum/).

When declaring your global annual revenue category, you must take into account:

- Revenue from business activity globally inside or outside of your app (physical, digital, advertising, or otherwise).
- Revenue from associated corporate entities. An associated corporate entity is any other entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under the control of your company.
- Please convert any global business revenue in other currencies using the spot rate at the end of the period.
- The global business revenue must be from the most recent 12-month financial statement on the companyʼs record. If this is not available, you may declare your global business revenue from the last 12 months.

Small developers need to declare they are within a global annual revenue each year to maintain their eligibility for the 3-year on-ramp to the CTF.

Developers who declare revenue less than €10 million may remain in the free on-ramp or the €1 million cap tier for a total of 3 years as they grow their business. During this period of 3 continuous years, developers may move between tiers as their business changes. After 3 years, they will be charged for each first annual install after the initial one million first annual installs per year.

**Note: **Enrollment in the App Store Small Business Program does not automatically qualify you for the on-ramp to the CTF. Additional enrollment is required. The App Store Small Business Program features a reduced App Store commission rate on paid apps and In-App Purchases distributed on the App Store in 175 territories. Program eligibility is based on your total App Store proceeds, which are your sales net of Apple’s commission and certain taxes and adjustments.

The CTF is a separate fee for each first annual install over one million for apps distributed in the EU via the App Store, Web Distribution, and/or alternative app marketplaces. Eligibility for the free on-ramp and/or cap for the CTF is based on your global business revenue and whether your apps have ever exceeded one million first annual installs.

### FAQs

### What if someone downloads my app on multiple devices within a 12-month period?

We only count one first annual install per app per Apple account in the EU in any 12-month period. For example, if someone has two iPhones and installs your app on both phones, within a 12-month period using the same account, Apple only counts one first annual install.

### Will I be charged if someone upgrades their iPhone and transfers my app to their new device?

No. iCloud transfers are never considered a first annual install, even if more than 12 months have passed since that account installed your app. [ Learn about what can be considered a first annual install](/help/app-store-connect/distributing-apps-in-the-european-union/first-annual-install-types).

### How is my fee impacted if someone installs an app from the App Store, then installs it again later from an alternative app marketplace or a developer’s website?

As long as the app is installed by the same Apple account in the EU within 12 months of the first annual install, subsequent installs are free, even if the app is installed from a different source. For example, if someone installs your app for the first time from the App Store, deletes it, then reinstalls it from an alternative app marketplace within 12 months of their first annual install, you won’t be charged again for the subsequent install.

### What happens if I have fewer than one million first annual installs in the past 12 months?

If you have fewer than one million first annual installs in the past 12 months, you won’t pay a Core Technology Fee that month.

### What kind of apps are counted?

Only installs on iOS and/or iPadOS by Apple accounts in the EU may be counted as first annual installs. However, users who install the same app on both iOS and iPadOS within a 12-month period will only generate one first annual install for that app. Automatic installs of universal purchase apps onto platforms such as macOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS are not counted as first annual installs. And if someone installs an iPadOS app onto a compatible device, such as an Apple Vision Pro, that install also won’t count as a first annual install.

### How does Apple count first annual installs for volume purchases from Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager?

Apps purchased using Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager may only be counted as first annual installs once the app is installed. For example, if someone purchases 100 copies of your app through Apple Business Manager and only installs 20 of those copies onto their corporate devices, only those 20 installs may be counted as potential first annual installs.

## create-a-sandbox-apple-account

Test In-App Purchases

# Create a Sandbox Apple Account

If your app offers In-App Purchases or Apple Pay, you can test this functionality by creating Sandbox accounts in App Store Connect and using them to sign in to devices that are running a development-signed version of your app. You’ll need to [enable Developer Mode on each device](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device) so you can use it to test your app.

With a Sandbox account, you can test different payment scenarios (such as successful subscription renewals, payment failures, and refunds), as well as Family Sharing functionality. This is important for ensuring that In-App Purchases work as expected and that there are no issues with the payment process.

You can create up to 10,000 Sandbox accounts in App Store Connect. These accounts are only valid for testing purposes and can’t be used to sign in to or make purchases on the App Store.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, or Developer. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Create a Sandbox account

1. From the homepage, click Users and Access.
2. In the top navigation, click Sandbox, then click the add button (+). If it’s your first time adding sandbox testers, click Create Test Accounts.

![Test Accounts page with two existing sandbox accounts. The add icon (+) is next to the Test Accounts header.](/help/app-store-connect/test-in-app-purchases/manage-sandbox-apple-account-settings/images/create-sandbox_2x.png)
3. Enter a first and last name for your tester.

**Note: **Once you create a tester, you can’t edit the name, email, or password.
4. Enter an email address. Use an email address that hasn’t been used as Apple Account or to purchase iTunes or App Store content. Consider creating a dedicated email address for each sandbox tester.

If your email service provider supports email subaddressing with a plus sign (+), you can use subaddresses of a sandbox-specific address for a sandbox tester. For example, if your base sandbox email is `billjames2@icloud.com`, you can use `billjames2+UK@icloud.com`, `billjames2+US@icloud.com`, and `billjames2+JP@icloud.com` as email addresses for additional testers. All communications sent to the subaddresses are also sent to the base address.
5. Enter a password. Like standard accounts, Sandbox accounts require strong passwords. When you enter a password, recommendations display if your password doesn't meet the requirements.
6. Choose an App Store country or region. Each test account is associated with one of the 175 App Store storefronts. You can [edit a tester’s App Store country or region](/help/app-store-connect/test-in-app-purchases/manage-sandbox-apple-account-settings#edit-country-or-region-on-the-app-store) after the account is created to test on different storefronts using the same Sandbox account, without having to create new testers.
7. Click Create.

### Delete a Sandbox account

You can delete a tester by clicking their Sandbox account in the list of test accounts, then clicking Delete Account. Alternatively, you can take the following steps to delete multiple testers at once.

**Note: **Testers that are part of a Sandbox Test Family must be [removed from the family](/help/app-store-connect/test-in-app-purchases/manage-sandbox-apple-account-settings#manage-a-sandbox-test-family) before they can be deleted.

1. From the homepage, click Users and Access.
2. In the top navigation, click Sandbox.
3. Select the checkbox for each tester you want to delete, then click Delete Account.

![Test Accounts page with one sandbox account checked. The Delete Account button appears in the upper-right corner.](/help/app-store-connect/test-in-app-purchases/manage-sandbox-apple-account-settings/images/sandbox-delete_2x.png)
4. In the dialog that appears, click Delete Account.

If you delete a sandbox tester, the associated Sandbox account and email can no longer be used as an App Store Connect user, to test in the sandbox environment, or to make purchases on the iTunes Store or App Store.

5. Choose a traffic proportion. This is the percentage of users that’ll be randomly shown a test treatment instead of your original product page. For example, if a test has three treatments and you choose a 30% traffic proportion, each treatment will be shown to 10% of the total traffic.
6. Select the localizations you want to include in your test. By default, all localizations that your app supports are selected. If the localization shown to a user is excluded from your test, the user won’t be included in the test.
7. To view how long it might take to reach your goal, click the arrow next to Estimate Your Test Duration and choose your desired improvement in conversion rate. We use your app’s existing performance data, such as daily impressions and new downloads, to generate this estimate. The estimated duration and impressions needed will appear. This estimate is provided as a guide and won’t impact the test. A test runs for 90 days or until you manually stop it within that time. Keep in mind that it may not be possible to reach your desired improvement in conversion rate within 90 days.
8. Click Create Test.

## create-and-submit-app-bundles

Create an app record

# Create and submit app bundles

You can offer apps, including those part of a universal purchase, as an app bundle on the App Store. App bundles simplify the process for you, letting you group up to ten of your apps together in a single download.

Apps in a bundle must follow these guidelines:

- All apps must be either all paid or all free.
- A paid app bundle can only include paid apps and must be offered at a reduced price.
- You must ensure that each app in a free app bundle is free and offers an auto-renewable subscription. The subscription must allow the user to subscribe to and access content or services in all apps included in the bundle.

Customers purchase the bundle with a single tap or click, and the individual apps install automatically on their device. Customers who have previously bought one or more apps in an app bundle can use the Complete My Bundle feature. The bundle price adjusts to reflect their existing purchases.

![Screenshot of the Apps page which is displaying 4 apps and 1 app bundle](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/create-and-submit-an-app-bundle/images/app-bundle-overview_2x.png)

All apps in a bundle must support the same platform as the first app you add, known as the *primary app*.

If the primary app supports multiple platforms, you can add an app that supports all of the same platforms or more, an app that supports only one of the platforms or any combination of these apps. However, if you add an app that supports only one of the shared platforms, all subsequent apps must also support that platform. Additionally, apps that support tvOS only can’t be part of a bundle.

## create-offer-codes-for-in-app-purchases

Manage In-App Purchases

# Create offer codes for In-App Purchases

Offer codes provide a way to acquire, retain, and win back customers by offering discounted or free access to In-App Purchases. You create and manage offer codes in App Store Connect, defining the eligibility criteria for redemption. Customers can redeem offer codes through a redemption URL, or by entering the code directly in the App Store, or within your app. You can have up to 10 active offers at a time, with a limit of 1 million codes per app, per quarter.

You define the eligibility criteria for who can redeem the code, including users who:

- Never purchased within your app.
- Purchased within your app in the last 30 days.
- Purchased within your app more than 30 days ago.

You can create offer and sandbox codes for your app regardless of its current App Status. However, to generate custom or unique offer codes, your app must be Ready for Distribution, and the associated In-App Purchase must be Approved.

Carefully consider your offer's eligibility requirements before creating and distributing offer codes.

There are three types of offer codes available:

### One-time-use codes

Unique, randomly generated codes that can each be redeemed only once.

- **How customers redeem:** Customers can redeem these codes through a unique redemption URL, by manually entering the code in the App Store, or directly within your app (if your app supports it). You can set set an expiration date with a maximum of 6 months, after which the code will no longer be valid.
- **In-app redemption requirement:** Redemption within your app requires the customer to be using a device running iOS 16.3, macOS 15.0, or visionOS 1.0 or later, and your app must support the [appropriate StoreKit method](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/supporting-subscription-offer-codes-in-your-app).
- **Best for:**

- Small-scale distribution (i.e., giving codes to individuals as a special discount, or contest winners).
- Situations where you need strict control over who can redeem the offer (i.e., a limited-quantity giveaway, codes for event attendees only, or a codes to print on a product).
- Targeted promotions with limited distribution.
- **Redemption:** Each app can have up to 1 million codes per quarter, shared across all In-App Purchases. Customers are limited to redeeming one code per offer. Codes will expire after a maximum of six months.

### Custom codes

Codes you create yourself, using a unique name (i.e., `SUMMER25`, `VIPACCESS`). Unlike one-time use codes, a custom code can be redeemed by multiple users, up to a limit you set.

- **How customers redeem:** Customers can redeem these codes through a redemption URL or directly within your app (if your app supports it).
- **In-app redemption requirement:** Redemption within your app requires the customer to be using a device running iOS 16.3, macOS 15.0, or visionOS 1.0 or later, and your app must support the [appropriate StoreKit method](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/supporting-subscription-offer-codes-in-your-app).
- **Best for:**

- Large-scale marketing campaigns (i.e., promoting a discount to all new users).
- Promotions targeted at specific customer groups (i.e., offering a special deal to users who haven't opened the app in 30 days).
- Acquiring, retaining, or winning back specific customer cohorts.
- **Redemption:** Each app can have up to 1 million codes per quarter, shared across all In-App Purchases. Customers are limited to redeeming one code per offer. Codes will expire after a maximum of six months.

### Sandbox codes

One-time use codes for testing purposes. You can test offer redemptions through your sandbox Account settings on iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 or later, and if your app supports the [appropriate StoreKit method](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/supporting-subscription-offer-codes-in-your-app).

- **Best for:**

- Verifying the end-to-end offer code redemption flow in your app's sandbox environment.
- Testing different offer configurations (such as price) without affecting real users or production data.
- Confirming that your app correctly handles receipt validation and entitlement granting processes for offer code redemptions.
- **Redemption limits:** Each app can distribute up to 10,000 sandbox test codes per quarter, shared across all In-App Purchases. Sandbox test accounts have no redemption limits; if redemptions are blocked, [clear the purchase history for the sandbox Apple account](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/testing-in-app-purchases-with-sandbox#Clear-the-purchase-history-for-a-Sandbox-Apple-Account) and retest. Code expiration is optional for sandbox test codes.

# Dark Interface evaluation criteria

iOS
macOS
tvOS
visionOS
watchOS

### Description

Users with light sensitivity can maintain a dark user interface for the common tasks of the app to reduce eye pain or discomfort.

### Goals

Everyone should be able to use your app, regardless of whether they have a disability. The goal of the Dark Interface capability is to support users with light sensitivity for whom large white or bright areas on the screen may cause discomfort or even physical pain. Keep this in mind, because the goal isn't only to make the interface dark, but to keep it that way. Even temporary flashes of bright content may cause discomfort or a difficult user experience.

The following sections provide more detail about how to determine whether your app supports a Dark Interface well. The goal is to help ensure users with disabilities can leverage all common tasks of the app, therefore performing this evaluation will help you determine whether to indicate your app **Supports Dark Interface** on the App Store.

### Getting started with testing

While you’re not required to use Apple frameworks to indicate support for Dark Interface, we recommend reviewing how Apple’s system apps respond to the systemwide setting to understand what a good experience is like for users. If you offer your own in-app setting, it should either support similar functionality to the systemwide setting, or offer more granular user interface customization.

To ensure proficiency in testing with a dark interface, review the resources below to learn how to turn on Dark Mode for each device your app supports.

- For iPhone, visit [Adjust the screen brightness and color on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph60ba71065).
- For iPad, visit [Adjust the screen brightness and color on iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad997d972d).
- For Mac, visit [Use a light or dark appearance on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchl52e1c2d2).
- For Apple Vision Pro, visit [Change the appearance of text, app windows, and more on Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/tan4fa040b9f).

A common mistake is supporting sufficient contrast in your light mode interface, but forgetting to support sufficient contrast in a dark interface. Many developers use gray-on-black for dark mode reading, which can reduce eye strain for standard vision in low-light scenarios, but this reduced contrast variant may be more difficult to read for those with low vision or light sensitivity. Consider testing your app while combining the dark mode color scheme alongside the *Increase Contrast* accessibility setting.

## Indicating support for Dark Interface

You may indicate support if your app is dark by default for all common tasks, excluding any third-party or user-generated content. For example, most apps on tvOS and watchOS are dark by default.

If your app isn’t dark by default for all common tasks, you may still indicate support if it allows the user to enable a mode or setting that keeps the interface dark. This can include supporting the systemwide [Dark Mode](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode) appearance or using a custom dark color scheme, or as a last resort, supporting the systemwide *Smart Invert* accessibility setting.

- Be careful of unintended color changes that may cause user confusion. For example, if relying on the Smart Invert setting, a red “Delete” button may invert to green if you don’t account for the color inversion. Additionally, when Smart Invert is enabled, make sure the colors in the media don’t appear inverted.
- For translucent views, including Apple Vision Pro apps using passthrough, you may indicate support for Dark Interface if your app renders only dark UI. You’re not responsible for background light filtering through your app. However, consider whether your app should reduce the translucency if the system *Increase Contrast* or *Reduce Transparency* settings are enabled.
- If third-party or user-generated content is required in your common tasks, refer to the detailed guidance for third-party content on the [Overview of Accessibility Nutrition Labels](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels#tips).

Even after you’re able to indicate support for Dark Interface in the common tasks of your app, there are likely further improvements you’ll be able to make to the accessibility of your app. Re-evaluate your app’s support for Dark Interface every time you update your app. Set a goal to make your app more accessible to more people in every release.

# Differences in reporting tools

## Comparing Sales and Trends with Payments and Financial Reports

Differences between reports in Sales and Trends and those in Payments and Financial may occur for the following reasons:

- **Processing status. **Processing and closing transactions may take time. Transactions initiated in a particular month may not appear in Sales and Trends Reports until the customer's payment is processed, collected, and invoiced, possibly in the following fiscal month. Additionally, transactions without collected payments don't appear in financial reports.
- **Exchange rate. **Sales and Trends estimates sales and proceeds in USD using a rolling average of previous month's exchange rates. All downloadable reports display amounts in local currencies as transacted by customers. Payments and Financial Reports finalize payments using the exchange rate applied to convert each report’s currency to your bank account’s currency. [Learn about the exchange rate.](/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/overview-of-receiving-payments)

## Comparing App Analytics and Sales and Trends

Differences may occur between sales reports in App Analytics and those in Sales and Trends for the following reasons:

- App Analytics data is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). By default, Sales and Trends data is shown in UTC, but you can change the timezone to Pacific Time (PT).
- App Analytics excludes Restores (where a user restores an app to their device from a backup) in the Redownloads metric, while Sales and Trends includes Restores in its Redownload count.
- App Analytics excludes sales metrics (In-App Purchases, sales, paying users, proceeds) from TestFlight builds, while Sales and Trends includes them.
- App Analytics excludes Sales or Redownloads on watchOS.
- App Analytics excludes In-App Purchase transactions (such as auto-renewable subscription renewals) from Removed from Sale apps, while Sales and Trends includes them.
- Certain transactions may not be reported on the same dates in App Analytics and Sales and Trends due to processing time differences between the two systems.

# Differentiate Without Color Alone evaluation criteria

iOS
macOS
tvOS
visionOS
watchOS

### Description

Users shouldn't have to rely on color to distinguish different selection states or values in an app. Instead, apps should use additional methods beyond color, such as text labels or icons, to convey information to users with common forms of color blindness.

### Goals

Everyone should be able to use your app, regardless of whether they have a disability. The goal is to ensure that your app doesn’t exclude users who may not be able to perceive all colors. Color blindness is one of the most common forms of disability, affecting up to 10% of some populations.

Color is *extremely* useful in communicating information quickly. Don’t remove color from your app to support this capability; just make sure color isn’t the *only* way you’re conveying information.

The following sections provide more detail about how to determine whether your app supports Differentiate Without Color Alone well. The goal is to help ensure users with disabilities can leverage all common tasks of the app, therefore performing this evaluation will help you determine whether to indicate your app **Supports Differentiate Without Color Alone** on the App Store.

### Getting started with testing

A great way to evaluate your app is to try testing using the *Grayscale* color filter in Accessibility Display settings. While this's *not* a representation of what color-blind users see, it's a good way to discover unanticipated problems with the use of color in your app. If you can’t use your own app in grayscale, rethink your app’s design and differentiate without color *alone*.

Ideally, your app should be designed by default to convey information using more than color alone. Using a setting to invoke this experience should be a last resort or stop-gap solution until your app's reliance on color can be improved.

## Indicating support for Differentiate Without Color Alone

You may indicate your app supports Differentiate Without Color Alone if the common tasks of your app don't rely on color as the ***only*** way to convey information. For example, a game may distinguish teams using symbols, in addition to representing them with colors. If your app does use color as the only differentiator (e.g. color-coded charts), make sure that users can customize the design for their needs with a setting or by choosing multiple color schemes.

- Consider where your elements, controls, or content rely solely on color to differentiate or communicate key information. Examples include status buttons or icons whose only distinguishing difference is red 🔴 vs green 🟢 to indicate positive or negative, online or offline. This visual difference may not be easy for people with red-green color-blindness to perceive.
- Instead of relying on color alone, consider using placement, order, shape, iconography, or other stylistic differences *in addition* to color. Differences like a red square 🟥 or green circle 🟢 are perceivable by all sighted users, regardless of color perception ability.
- Consider allowing multiple color schemes so users can avoid the problematic color combinations they have difficulty distinguishing. One example is in apps and games where color is used to indicate different teams or characters.
- In complex charts or data visualization apps, consider arranging the chart colors in the same order as the legend keys. Alternatively, you can provide options for in-chart iconography or labels on each element directly to help communicate the data.

**Note: **These differences reduce cognitive load and help users of all abilities remember what each color means.

![Example of inaccessible status indicators: two circles differentiated only by color, green and red.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/differentiate-without-color-alone-evaluation-criteria/images/indicating-support-for-differentiate-without-color-alone_2x.png)

  For Someone with red-green color blindness, these indicators might appear the same.

![Example of accessible status indicators: a green circled checkmark glyph and a red octagon containing an 'X'. This design uses both color and shape to differentiate.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/differentiate-without-color-alone-evaluation-criteria/images/indicating-support-for-differentiate-without-color-alone2_2x.png)

 Both visual indicators and color help differentiate between indicators.
- If third-party or user-generated content is required in your common tasks, refer to the detailed guidance for third-party content on the [Overview of Accessibility Nutrition Labels](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels#tips).

Even after you’re able to indicate support for Differentiate Without Color Alone in the common tasks of your app, there are likely further improvements you’ll be able to make to the accessibility of your app. Re-evaluate your app’s support for Differentiate Without Color Alone every time you update the app. Set a goal to make your app more accessible to more people in every release.

## edit-app-bundle-information

Create an app record

# Edit app bundle information

You can edit which apps belong to your app bundle only until App Review approves it. If you have submitted your app bundle to App Review and it‘s still pending approval, you can [remove it from review](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/create-and-submit-app-bundles) to make changes.

You can make the following changes without needing additional review:

- Rearrange the apps in the bundle
- Edit the bundle description and marketing URL
- Change the primary language of the bundle
- Adjust the pricing and availability of the bundle
- Use an automatically generated app bundle icon
- Remove custom app bundle icon

Your app bundle requires another review if you make the following changes:

- Add localizations
- Change an existing app bundle name or a custom app bundle icon

To change a property of derived metadata, [edit the app information](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/view-and-edit-app-information) for the primary app. The app bundle metadata updates automatically when you make changes to the app's information. Alternatively, you can choose a different primary app for the app bundle.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, or Marketing. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Edit app bundle information

1. In Apps, select the app bundle you want to view.
2. Under App information, edit the name, description, or marketing URL.
3. To add, delete, or reorder the apps in the bundle, click the Edit button next to Apps in This Bundle.

Making changes to the apps in the bundle—adding, deleting, or rearranging them—will update the derived information once you save those changes.
4. Under Availability and Price, change the price or select or unselect Cleared for Sale option.
5. On the top right, click Save.

### Remove a custom app bundle icon

The ability to upload a bundle icon has been deprecated. If your app bundle is using a custom app bundle icon, you can delete it at any time. Your bundle reverts back and App Store Connect automatically generates an icon that displays for the first four apps in your bundle.

**Note: **Once the custom icon has been removed, you can only use the default icon going forward.

1. In Apps, select the app bundle you want to view.
2. Scroll down to the General Information section.
3. Hold the pointer over the icon you want to delete, then click the delete button (–).

## Set availability for an app bundle

After submitting an app bundle for App Review, and it’s been approved, it’ll automatically become available for sale when all apps within the bundle are available and all other requirements are met.

For an app bundle to be available, it must meet the following requirements:

- All apps in the bundle must be either all paid or all free. A paid app bundle can only include paid apps and must be offered at a reduced price. Each app in a free app bundle must be free and offer at least one auto-renewable subscription.
- Paid app bundles must be sold at a reduced price, which is a price tier lower than the sum of the individual app prices in the bundle.
- A paid app bundle’s price must not be lower than the highest app price in the bundle. If an app in the bundle goes to a price that’s higher than the price of the bundle, the bundle will automatically be removed from the store.
- There are no bundle-specific country or region settings. An app bundle will be live only where all member apps have common countries or regions.
- Only ten bundles can be marked as cleared for sale at any given time per developer account. If you have ten bundles marked as cleared for sale, you can create additional bundles, but you can’t select Cleared for Sale option for an additional bundle unless you first unselect it from another bundle.
- A single app can be in no more than three cleared-for-sale bundles at one time.

### View an app bundle’s availability

While an app bundle can have the status Ready for Sale, it might not be available on the App Store. You can check its availability from the app bundle page.

1. In Apps, select the app bundle you want to view.

If the app bundle isn’t available, a warning message appears at the top of the page. The message states the reasons that the app bundle isn’t available, such as incompatible pricing.

![Screenshot of a warning message that reads “To make this bundle available on the App Store, you must choose a compatible price.” displays on the App bundle detail page.](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/edit-app-bundle-information/images/app-bundle-price-error_2x.png)
2. Under Availability and Price, you can view the reason why your app bundle might not be available in a specific country or region.

For example, this section might show that the number of countries or regions is 0.

![Screenshot of the Availability and Price section of the App Bundle page, that includes the number of countries or regions (out of 175) where your app bundle is available displays below Countries or Regions. This number is clickable.](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/edit-app-bundle-information/images/app-bundle-countries-or-regions-error_2x.png)
3. To view the country or region details, click the number of countries or regions on the top right.

The reason the app bundle isn’t available in a country or region appears in the Reason column.

![Screenshot of the Countries or Regions detail page, where a table lists all the countries and regions, showing your app bundle's status in each one. When applicable, the table also provides a reason why the app bundle isn’t available in a particular country or region.](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/edit-app-bundle-information/images/app-bundle-countries-or-regions-error-details_2x.png)

### Remove an app bundle from sale

Once approved, you can’t delete an app bundle, but you can remove it from the App Store.

1. In Apps, select the app bundle you want to view.
2. In the Availability and Price section, unselect Cleared for Sale.

Manage subscriptions

# Enable Billing Grace Period for auto-renewable subscriptions

Billing Grace Period lets subscribers whose auto-renewal failed due to a payment issue continue accessing your app’s paid content for a period of time while Apple continues to attempt to collect payment. There won’t be any interruption to the subscriber’s days of paid service or to your revenue if Apple recovers the subscription within the grace period. Without enabling Billing Grace Period, the subscriber’s days of paid service pause until Apple is able to collect payment.

**Note: **It may take up to 1 hour for changes you make to product metadata to appear in the sandbox environment.

[You can configure grace periods in App Store Connect using the App Store Connect API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/app_store/auto-renewable_subscriptions/managing_auto-renewable_subscriptions)

### Workflow for enabling Billing Grace Period

Enabling Billing Grace Period requires you turn on and complete configurations in App Store Connect, and use StoreKit to verify subscribers’ renewal states so they retain access to subscription content while in the billing retry state.

The following workflow can be used to properly test and validate your server to app’s logic before fully rolling out the feature to your subscribers.

1. **Turn on Billing Grace Period in sandbox.**

Make sure to do this only before turning it on in production.
2. **Test Billing Grace Period in sandbox.**

Use the sandbox environment to validate your client and server logic to handle subscribers entering and exiting the grace period. [View implementation guidance.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/original_api_for_in-app_purchase/subscriptions_and_offers/reducing_involuntary_subscriber_churn)
3. **Turn on Billing Grace Period in production.**

Once you validate your client and server logic, edit your Billing Grace Period configuration to support the production environment.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin or App Manager. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Turn on Billing Grace Period

You can turn on Billing Grace Period for each app in App Store Connect to provide a grace period for all auto-renewable subscriptions in the app. Configurability isn’t available for individual subscription products.

1. From Apps, select your app.
2. In the sidebar, click Subscriptions.
3. In the Billing Grace Period section, click Set Up Billing Grace Period.
4. From the menu, select a period of 3, 16, or 28 days to apply across all subscription products in your app.

**Note: **If your app offers weekly subscriptions, even if you select a 16 or 28 day grace period, the actual grace period will only be 6 days to ensure it isn't longer than the subscription itself.

Your selection will only apply to subscription products in production. [Learn about the Billing Grace Period renewal rates in sandbox.](/help/app-store-connect/test-in-app-purchases/manage-sandbox-apple-account-settings#edit-subscription-renewal-speed)

|  | 3 day Billing Grace Period | 16 day Billing Grace Period | 28 day Billing Grace Period |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly subscriptions | 3 days | 6 days | 6 days |
| Monthly and yearly subscriptions | 3 days | 16 days | 28 days |
5. Select the renewal types for which you want to enable a grace period:

- **All Renewals:** Billing Grace Period applies to all renewals, including free introductory offers and free subscription offers transitioning to paid subscriptions.
- **Only Paid to Paid Renewals:** Billing Grace Period will only apply to subscriptions in a currently paid period, therefore subscriptions currently in a Free period won’t receive a billing grace period.
6. Select the server environments for which you want to enable Billing Grace Period.

- **Only Sandbox Environment:** Billing Grace Period is enabled in the sandbox environment only. Use Sandbox to test that your app provides service to subscriptions during a grace period.
- **Production and Sandbox Environment:** Billing Grace Period is enabled in both sandbox and production environments.
7. Click Confirm.

Your app still needs to perform purchase validation and account for the subscriber’s renewal status to identify if a subscription is in a Billing Grace Period.

### Edit Billing Grace Period configuration

1. From Apps, select your app.
2. In the sidebar, click Subscriptions.
3. In the Billing Grace Period section, click Edit. You can edit the duration of the grace period, the eligible renewal types, and the enabled environments. Changes can take up to 24 hours to take effect and will only apply to upcoming renewals. Subscribers currently in Billing Grace Period are still entitled to service during their grace period.
4. Click Done.

### Turn off Billing Grace Period

You can turn off Billing Grace Period for each app.

1. From Apps, select your app.
2. In the sidebar, click Subscriptions.
3. In the Billing Grace Period section, click Edit.
4. Click Turn Off.

Once you turn off Billing Grace Period, subscribers whose renewal fails due to a billing issue won’t accumulate days of paid service until Apple is able to collect payment and renew the subscription. Ensure that your app continues to provide service for subscriptions that are already in Billing Grace Period.

## estimate-fees-for-alternative-business-terms

Understanding the Core Technology Fee

# Estimate fees for alternative business terms

Apple offers an Alternative Terms Addendum for developers distributing apps in the European Union (EU), which allows them to distribute apps outside the App Store. For developers who want nothing to change for them — from how the App Store works currently and in the rest of the world — no action is needed, and they can continue to distribute their apps only on the App Store and use its private and secure In-App Purchase system. For those who adopt the new terms, the fees you may owe to Apple may change. Access the available data to help you determine how these terms may apply to your business if you choose to adopt them, including new App Install reports, and the Sales and Trends dashboard.

This information is provided for estimation purposes only.

To understand potential fees if you choose the new business terms, you can use your app’s historical performance to estimate future fees. You'll need:

- The number of first annual installs your app generated in a 12 month period, which is available in the Historical App Install Reports in Sales and Trends. Fees won’t be charged against installs in these reports.

**Note: **App Clip installs and installs from Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager aren't included in these reports, but will be measured and counted if you agree to the new business terms.
- *If you offer In-App Purchases:* Your app’s previous sales from iPhone and iPad devices in the EU, available in the Sales and Trends dashboard.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, Finance, or Sales with Reports. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Calculating the monthly fee

The Core Technology Fee is calculated by looking at the number of first annual installs in the past 12 months. On a monthly basis, developers are only billed for one-twelfth of the Core Technology Fee for each first annual install in excess of one million. If an app has fewer than one million first annual installs, there's no Core Technology Fee for that app that month.

For example, let’s look at the Forest Explorer app for the month of August. Apple looks back 12 months and considers the five months. In this case, the Forest Explorer app has generated 1.05 million first annual installs through the current month. In August, Apple only charges one-twelfth of the Core Technology Fee owed for the 50,000 first annual installs over one million, resulting in an amount of €2,083.33 due for that month. The developer will receive an invoice for the month of August presenting the monthly fee.

![Diagram breaking down the calculation of monthly fees.](/help/app-store-connect/understanding-the-core-technology-fee/estimate-fees-for-alternative-business-terms/images/monthly-fees_2x.png)

**Note: **

In many cases, developers who exceed one million first annual installs do not pay the CTF, including:

- Non-profit organizations, governments and education institutions with an Apple Developer Program fee waiver.
- Non-commercial developers with a no revenue business offering a free app without any monetization.
- Small developers (earning less than €10 million global business revenue) that have not previously exceeded one million first annual installs receive a 3-year free on-ramp to the CTF.

Learn more about these conditions under the ["How the fee works"](/help/app-store-connect/understanding-the-core-technology-fee/core-technology-fee-overview#how-the-fee-works) section to help you put these business terms into context with your own performance.

- **Version 1_0:** historical report of first annual installs from only iPhone devices in 2023.
- **Version 1_1:** historical reports of first annual installs from both iPhone and iPad devices in 2023.
- **Version 1_2:** historical reports of first annual installs from both iPhone and iPad devices for any 12 month period.

To download them through App Store Connect on the web:

1. In the App Store Connect homepage, click Sales and Trends.
2. On the left, choose Sales and Trends Reports.
3. Go to the Historical App Install Reports section.
4. Choose a vendor.
5. Use the date picker to select a desired month or year.
6. Click Download.

### Estimate your Core Technology Fee

1. Open the extracted Install Summary report file in a spreadsheet application.
2. Headers at the top of the report indicate your developer name, the region (European Union), and the reporting year.
3. Data appears for the number of first annual installs generated by each app in your developer account, including the number of first annual installs above the threshold, the total number of first annual installs for each app, and a breakdown of first annual installs by install type.

### Estimate your sales on iPhone and iPad devices in the EU

If you sell digital goods and services in your app, you can input your sales data from Sales and Trends into the fee calculator to understand how your commission may change under the new fee model.

1. In the App Store Connect homepage, click Sales and Trends.
2. On the left, choose Sales.
3. In the date picker, select your desired date range. Ensure the date range matches the range of the historical App Install report you're using to estimate potential install fees.
4. Select “Add Filters”, “Device”, “iPhone”, and "iPad".
5. Select "Add Filters", "Territory". Under "My Groups", select "European Union".
6. Select “Add Filters”, “Parent App”, and enter the name or Apple ID of the app you want to evaluate.
7. A rounded sales value appears at the top of the dashboard. For a more exact value, click the export button on the top right of the chart and choose your preferred export option.
8. If you have exported your data from the chart, open the file in your preferred spreadsheet program and scroll all the way to the right to view your total sales on iPhone and iPad in the European Union.
9. Subtract any taxes applicable to your sales from this number. Consult your tax advisor if you have any questions.

Use the Historical App Install Reports to help you understand how you may accumulate first annual installs in the European Union if you choose to adopt the new business terms.

### FAQs

### I’m seeing two report versions when I download my Historical App Install reports. Which one should I use?

Report version 1_1 will include first annual install data from both iOS and iPadOS, whereas report version 1_0 only includes data from iOS. We recommend using report version 1_1 in order to understand how installs across iOS and iPadOS may impact the fees you owe.

### Why do the Historical App Install reports contain data for some of my apps, but not all of my apps?

Apps must have received at least one install from an Apple account in the EU on iOS or iPadOS in 2023 in order to appear in the Historical App Install reports.

### When I try to download the Historical App Install reports, there’s a message that says “Your apps did not generate any data for this report in the selected reporting period.” What does this mean?

If none of your apps generated any installs in the EU on iOS or iPadOS in 2023, you’ll receive this message when you try to download your Historical App Install reports.

### My app launched this year, but I’m seeing reinstalls and updates appear as first annual installs in my reports. Why is this happening?

In some cases, users may first install your app in regions outside the EU or on devices other than iPhone before downloading your app on iOS in the EU. Since first annual installs can only occur on iOS in the EU and these users may have already installed your app outside iOS or the EU, these first annual installs may appear as reinstalls or updates.

## generate-a-shared-secret-to-verify-receipts

Configure In-App Purchase settings

# Generate a shared secret to verify receipts

Include a shared secret in your request to verify App Store subscription or In-App Purchase receipts to increase security between your server and Apple's servers.

A shared secret is a 32-character hexadecimal string generated in App Store Connect. You may generate a primary shared secret, which is a single code for all your apps, or an app-specific shared secret for individual apps. You may also use a primary shared secret for some of your apps, and an app-specific shared secret for others.

For information about incorporating a shared secret into your app’s receipt handling, visit [Validating Receipts with the App Store](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/original_api_for_in-app_purchase/validating_receipts_with_the_app_store).

**Required role: **Account Holder or Admin. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### View or generate a shared secret for all your apps (primary shared secret)

1. In the homepage, click Users and Access.
2. Click the Integrations tab.
3. In the sidebar, under Keys, click Shared Secret.
4. Click Generate Primary Shared Secret.
5. Copy the code and use it for your transactions receipt for all of your apps with auto-renewable subscriptions.

When you generate a new shared secret, all apps in your organization that use a shared secret should use the new value to verify auto-renewable subscriptions.

### View or generate a shared secret for an individual app (app-specific shared secret)

Access the app-specific shared secret in the Subscriptions page of your app. You may want to use an app-specific shared secret if you want to keep this code private for this app, or if you're planning to transfer this app to another developer account.

**Note: **App-specific shared secrets can’t be deleted, only regenerated.

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the sidebar, under General, click App Information.
3. In the App-Specific Shared Secret section, click Manage.

![In-App Purchase app-specific shared secret](/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/generate-a-shared-secret-to-verify-receipts/images/In-App-Purchase-AppSpecificSharedSecret_2x.png)
4. You can generate a shared secret for individual apps, or regenerate a shared secret.

**Note: **Clicking Regenerate will automatically generate a new shared secret, and any previously generated shared secret for this app will be invalidated.
5. Then click Done.
6. To generate a shared secret, click Generate or Regenerate in the dialog.
7. Copy the code and use it for your transactions receipt for this app.

When you regenerate an app-specific shared secret, use the new value to verify your auto-renewable subscriptions for this app.

Managing alternative distribution

# Get an alternative distribution package ID

If you're distributing your app outside of the App Store through an alternative app marketplace or website, in countries and regions where eligible, you’ll need an alternative distribution package ID for each version of your app being distributed. The distributing developer’s web server ingests the alternative distribution package, which contains the data needed to support app installation.

An alternative distribution package automatically generates for an app version if it meets the following conditions:

- Your Account Holder agrees to the latest Developer Program License Agreement or the [Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the European Union](/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#distribution-eu) making your account eligible for alternative distribution in at least one country or region.
- The app is [eligible for distribution on at least one marketplace](/help/app-store-connect/managing-alternative-distribution/manage-distribution-on-an-alternative-app-marketplace) in App Store Connect. Or, if you’re distributing an app through alternative app marketplace or in the European Union (EU) through your own website, you’ve [added an alternative distribution domain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/alternative_marketplaces_and_web_distribution) using the App Store Connect API.
- The build associated with the app version supports iOS (or iPadOS if you're distributing in the EU).
- The app version is accepted on or after February 8, 2024, or the app version is Ready for Distribution, or Processing for Distribution, or Pending Developer Release, and its associated build is built with the iOS 16.1 SDK or later.

**Note: **You can choose to set up notifications so that Apple notifies the marketplace when there’s a new alternative distribution package available for your app. [Learn more.](/help/app-store-connect/managing-alternative-distribution/manage-distribution-on-an-alternative-app-marketplace)

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, or Marketing. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

1. From Apps, select your app. The page opens with the Distribution tab selected.
2. In the sidebar, click History.
3. Find the Alternative Distribution Package ID field next to an eligible app version.

![An Alternative Distribution Package ID appears next to Version 1.0 in the History section with a link to copy the ID next to it](/help/app-store-connect/managing-alternative-distribution/get-an-alternative-distribution-package-id/images/get-an-alternative-distribution-package-ID_2x.png)

The main In-App Purchase properties identify the product in App Store Connect and in the app.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Apple ID | A unique identifier automatically generated for your In-App Purchase when you add the In-App Purchase to your account. |
| Reference Name | A unique name you give to your In-App Purchase for internal tracking that's not visible to customers, but used in App Store Connect and Sales and Trends reports. The reference name can include any characters and can be as long as 64 characters.

The reference name can be edited at any time without review. |
| Product ID | A unique ID specific to your app that you can assign to your In-App Purchases to uniquely identify them within your app.

The product ID can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, periods, and underscores, and can be as long as 100 characters. You need separate identifiers for In-App Purchases in your iOS apps and your macOS apps.

When your app uses StoreKit to communicate with the App Store, it uses product IDs to retrieve the configuration data you provided for each In-App Purchase. When a user wants to make a purchase, your app identifies the In-App Purchase using its product ID.

The product ID isn't editable after you save the In-App Purchase.

Once a product ID is assigned to an in-app puchase, it can't be reused for another In-App Purchase within the same app, even if you delete the original In-App Purchase with that ID. |
| Review Notes | Additional information about the In-App Purchase that might help Apple review the submission, such as test user accounts and passwords. Review notes should not exceed 4000 characters. |
| Image | An image is required if you want to [promote your In-App Purchase](/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/promote-in-app-purchases) on your App Store product page or [set up win-back offers](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/set-up-win-back-offers). This image will represent your In-App Purchase in all countries or regions where your app is available. If you’re also using [offer codes](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/set-up-subscription-offer-codes) for auto-renewable subscriptions, your promotional image will appear on the App Store page when customers redeem their codes on iOS 14 or later. Your promotional image must meet the following requirements:

- JPG or PNG.
- Dimensions of 1024 x 1024 pixels.
- 72 dpi, RGB, flattened and no rounded corners. |
| Show to all App Store users, even those who don’t have the app installed | An indication that you'd like all customers to locate your promoted In-App Purchases, which is based on the user device information. By default, this is selected. If you deselect the checkbox, but haven’t implemented the [SKProductStorePromotionController API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skproductstorepromotioncontroller), your In-App Purchase will not be visible on the App Store. Visit [Promote In-App Purchases to relevant customers only](/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/promote-in-app-purchases). Note that a customer needs to have opened your app on their device at least once to locate your order and visibility settings inside your app. |
| App Review Screenshot | A screenshot of the In-App Purchase that clearly shows the item or service being offered. This screenshot is used for review only and isn't displayed on the App Store.

Upload a screenshot that meets any of the [screenshot specifications](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/screenshot-specifications) your app supports. Once you’ve uploaded a screenshot, you can update it but not remove it. |

## Localizable information

Add localizable In-App Purchases information used in the product display. You must include these properties for at least one language. For a list of languages, visit [App Store localizations](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-store-localizations).

Changes to the localized information require review. The existing text displays on the store until the new text is approved. The change has its own status separate from the overall status of the In-App Purchase. Before your changes are reviewed, you can revert the change.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Display Name | The name of the In-App Purchase that is displayed to customers. The display name must be at least two characters and no more than 30 characters. |
| Description | A description of the In-App Purchase that potentially displays to users. If you make your In-App Purchase available for promotion, this displays under your In-App Purchase name on the App Store. The description must be no more than 45 characters. |

## initiate-an-app-transfer

Transfer an app

# Initiate an app transfer

Before you begin, you’ll need the Apple Account for the Account Holder in the receiving organization and your app must meet the [criteria for an app transfer](/help/app-store-connect/transfer-an-app/app-transfer-criteria).

**Note:** Because an app is removed from your account after an app transfer, you should back up all information about the app for your records. It’s a good idea to keep a record of your appʼs metadata and pricing, note dates the app was available on the App Store, and save sales and download information.

**Required role: **Account Holder. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. Click App information under General in the sidebar, and scroll to the Additional Information section.
3. Click Transfer App.

You may be prompted to enter a two-factor authentication verification code in order to proceed. [Learn how to get a verification code.](https://support.apple.com/HT204974)
4. If all criteria have been met, click Continue. Otherwise, click Cancel and resolve the issues.

For details on how to resolve common issues, view [App transfer criteria](/help/app-store-connect/transfer-an-app/app-transfer-criteria).
5. Enter the Apple Account for the recipient’s Account Holder and Team ID for the account, and click Continue.
6. Read the terms, select “I have read and agree to the agreement presented above,” then click Request Transfer.
7. Click Done to return to the App information page.

After you initiate the transfer, the app stays in its previous status, with the Pending App Transfer status added, until the recipient accepts it or the transfer expires after 60 days.

While the app is in the Pending App Transfer state, you (the transferor) can’t edit some app information, like metadata, pricing, availability, and In-App Purchases. Any open App Review communications are closed. If the app is part of a Game Center group, the recipient can’t make changes to the group.

The transferor and the recipient can cancel an app transfer in [Business](https://www.apple.com/itunes/go/itunesconnect/contracts) while it is still in the Waiting for Recipient state. To cancel the transfer, the transferor must click Cancel Transfer next to the app in the App Transfers section of the Agreements tab.

## invite-external-testers

Test a beta version

# Invite external testers

External testers are people you invite to test your app who aren’t App Store Connect users. After uploading your build, you can invite up to 10,000 external testers per app. To make your build available for external testing, you need to create an external group, add builds, and invite testers using their email addresses or by sharing a [public invitation link.](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/invite-external-testers#invite-testers-using-a-public-link)

When inviting testers via a public link, you can set tester criteria, such as device and OS requirements, ensuring only qualified testers can accept the invitation. This facilitates the enrollment of relevant testers, who can then provide feedback for your beta app. [Learn how to set tester criteria when inviting testers using a public link](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/invite-external-testers#invite-testers-using-a-public-link).

Keep in mind that:

- To create an external group for external testing, you must first create an internal group for internal testing.
- Builds uploaded as TestFlight Internal Only from Xcode or Xcode Cloud are marked as internal under the build number and can only be added to internal tester groups.
- [Managed Apple Accounts](https://support.apple.com/HT210737) created in reserved domains can’t be used to test builds. Learn more about reserved domains in [Apple School Manager](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-school-manager/add-and-verify-a-domain-axm48c3280c0/web), [Apple Business Manager](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-manager/add-and-verify-a-domain-axm48c3280c0/web), or [Apple Business Essentials](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-essentials/add-and-verify-a-domain-axm48c3280c0/web).

[Learn how to manage tester invitations with the App Store Connect API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/prerelease_versions_and_beta_testers/beta_tester_invitations)

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, or App Manager. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Create a group

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. Click the TestFlight tab.
3. In the sidebar, click the add button (+) next to External Testing to add a new group.
4. In the dialog that appears, enter a group name, then click Create.

Later, you can change the name of the group if needed.

2. Click the TestFlight tab.
3. In the sidebar, under External Testing, select the group to which you want to add builds.
4. On the right, click Add Builds to choose which builds you want to add to this group.

**Note: **If you plan to [invite testers using a public link](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/invite-external-testers#invite-testers-using-a-public-link) and set criteria, ensure that the builds you add to the group are compatible with the criteria you’ve set. You can review the insight cards at the top of the group's details page to check for any incompatible builds that have been added.

![Screenshot of the App Store Connect page open in the TestFlight tab. The group name dialog displays. Below the group name, are the buttons Add Builds and Invite Testers.](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/invite-external-testers/images/tf_add_external_builds_2x.png)

**Note: **You can add only one build at a time, but you can add more later. To add additional builds to a group, click the add button (+) next to Builds on the tester group page.
5. In the build dialog, select the platform and version from the pop-up menus.
6. In the table, select a build, then click Add.

10. Depending on the build's status, click either Submit Review or Start Testing.

You can only have one build of each version in review at a time. Once that build is approved, you can submit additional builds.

If your build uses Apple-hosted asset packs, make sure to [submit the latest versions of any asset packs needed for testing](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/test-apple-hosted-asset-packs#submit-asset-packs-for-external-testing) after submitting the build.

**Note: **You can submit up to six builds for TestFlight App Review within a 24-hour period.

After you submit your build to TestFlight App Review, Apple reviews the build and its accompanying metadata. The first build you submit requires a full review, but later builds for the same version might not.

If Apple approves your build for TestFlight beta testing, users on the App Store Connect account with the Admin role will receive an email notifying them of the approval.

If Apple rejects your build or metadata, the status of the build will be Rejected. You can click App Review from the sidebar under General to view the rejection details for your beta build.

**Note: **Enter test information, such as Feedback Email and Contact Information, if these details haven’t been provided in the Test information dialog.

## Invite external testers using a public link or email

Ensuring that extra large fonts work well in your app makes the interface more convenient and accessible to more people. While some low-vision or legally blind users may be able to manage default font sizes by using screen zoom or holding their device extremely close to see the text and small icons in your app, this isn't a good user experience.

The following sections provide more detail about how to determine whether your app supports Larger Text well. The goal is to help ensure users with disabilities can leverage all common tasks of the app, therefore performing this evaluation will help you determine whether to indicate your app **Supports Larger Text** on the App Store.

### Getting started with testing

Most accessibility guidelines recommend allowing users to enlarge their text to, at minimum, 200% larger than the default size. For some low-vision users, 200% may still not be enough, so you should strive to allow body text to scale as large as possible, while still retaining reasonable usability in your app. [Dynamic Type](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography#Supporting-Dynamic-Type) on iOS, for example, allows body text sizes over 300%, but developers sometimes forget to test their apps at the largest sizes, leading to overly truncated or overlapping text in some cases.

Be sure to design for and test small, medium, large, and extra large accessibility sizes.

While you’re not required to use Apple frameworks to indicate support for Larger Text, we recommend reviewing how Apple’s system apps respond to the systemwide settings to understand what a good experience is like for users. If you offer your own in-app setting, it should either support similar functionality to the systemwide setting, or offer more granular user interface customization.

To ensure proficiency in testing with larger text, review the linked resources below to learn how to adjust the system text size settings for each device your app supports.

- For iPhone, watch [“How to adjust text size on iPhone or iPad”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R0mpzMkSjI) and visit [Make text easier to read on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph3c076905a).
- For iPad, watch [“How to adjust text size on iPhone or iPad”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R0mpzMkSjI) and visit [Make text easier to read on iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad9a246013).
- For Apple Vision Pro, visit [Text display settings on Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/tan5b0340be2).
- For Apple Watch, visit [Adjust text size and other visual settings on Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/apd766b7bd85).

## Indicating support for Larger Text

You may indicate your app supports Larger Text if users can enlarge the text to at least 200% (or 140% on watchOS apps.) Ideally, users should have the option to resize text and meaningful icons even more. Most text in the main views should increase in size without negatively impacting readability due to an overlapping layout or severe truncation. If you have controls that can't reasonably increase in size, review the details below for other ways to make those perceivable, usable, and understandable.

Don’t rely on system-provided assistive technology like *Zoom* or *Hover Text* to claim support for Larger Text. These features are available to users regardless of your app’s implementation, so users will already be aware that they can enlarge most or all on-screen text to a sufficient size using Zoom or Hover Text.

The Larger Text label is useful to users of your app as a way to determine whether the user interface of your app supports font size enlargement separate from these built-in features like Zoom. You may indicate support for Larger Text if your app’s UI supports enlarging text to 200% or more than the default size, either by using an Apple-provided feature like [Dynamic Type](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography#Supporting-Dynamic-Type), or by using your own in-app font size control.

You’re not required to adopt Apple frameworks to indicate support for Larger Text, but we recommend detecting when a user has Apple system settings enabled so they don’t have to manually update another setting for the app to function as expected. If you offer your own in-app setting that has additional customization or granular controls, you may not need to use the Apple system setting.

If third-party or user-generated content is required in your common tasks, refer to the detailed guidance for third-party content on the [Overview of Accessibility Nutrition Labels](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels#tips).

**Use the system font size, or manage your own.**

Most iOS apps typically use [Dynamic Type](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/typography#Supporting-Dynamic-Type), but some developers of games or apps that rely heavily on the use of text may choose to manage their own font sizes with an in-app setting. You're not required to use an Apple API like Dynamic Type to indicate support for Larger Text, but for most apps, using the system frameworks is often easier and better than implementing your own.

Apple Books is a good example of an app that supports larger text well, but doesn’t rely on Dynamic Type. While the Books app doesn’t leverage the system font size setting, it offers more granular controls. For example, users can change text to their preferred size, and the app’s layout changes from two columns to a single column at larger text sizes in landscape orientation, so that low-vision users can perceive more words in an uninterrupted line of text.

Safari on iOS is another great example of an app with a custom font size controller. Since not all web pages scale to larger text sizes well, Safari allows users to adjust the font size for each site they visit. If your app uses a web view as part of its common tasks, provide a font size controller or let Safari handle this task for your users.

![Screenshot of an iPhone displaying enlarged text. A Reader settings overlay is visible, with buttons to increase and decrease the font size.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/larger-text-evaluation-criteria/images/larger-text-1_2x.png)

**Use responsive design principles to adjust layout and information hierarchy based on needed text size.**

Consider which text to enlarge to reinforce a clear information hierarchy to low-vision users of your app, and prioritize scaling the main content areas before repeated, predictable navigational elements.

On devices with smaller screens, you should also consider the value of screen real estate when determining which elements to scale. For example, the Back and Edit buttons remain small in the example below since they are repeated, predictable, but secondary elements of the user interface. Meanwhile, primary content and action buttons are enlarged and take advantage of the space available by extending elements to a full screen-width and lengthening the page. Vertical scrolling is preferred by low-vision users to avoid difficulty perceiving small sizes for primary content and action buttons. As seen in the example below, note that the layout of the message sender, receiver, and date, changes from horizontal to vertical to take advantage of the larger, more readable text size.

![Apple Mail app showing an email at smaller and larger font size. Several interface elements are re-flowed to allow more room for the larger text.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/larger-text-evaluation-criteria/images/larger-text-2_2x.png)

Keep in mind that some features, like Tab Bars, don’t grow with dynamic text to avoid overlapping valuable screen estate. Consider other ways to make those elements accessible, such as the Large Content Viewer.

![](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/larger-text-evaluation-criteria/images/larger-text-3_2x.png)

**Avoid overlapping text and excessive or unusable truncation.**

Scaling text to 200% or larger may result in unpredictable scenarios that require design consideration and testing, especially on devices with smaller screens. As text is enlarged, consider how that changes the experience:

- Content may overlap making it difficult to read.
- Content that was originally designed for a single line might become truncated, resulting in users only seeing the first several characters.

Follow these principles for a great experience: 

- Avoid overlapping text.
- Avoid truncating text to the point that it becomes unreadable or ambiguous for the user. Consider allowing the text to wrap to two or more lines instead of truncation.
- If text is truncated, ensure that users are still able to access the same information as if the text were smaller. For example, in a list view, you can truncate text to a single line or two as long as the full text is available in a different view so users can dive into the details.
- Test your app's larger text layout with different languages. In addition to languages with a longer average word length, test right-to-left languages and those with larger ascenders, descenders, and diacritics that may by clipped by layout constraints.

## Larger Text on watchOS apps

Due to the significantly smaller screens on Apple Watch, the largest Dynamic Type size on watchOS is about 150% larger than the default size, so watchOS app developers may indicate support for Larger Text by supporting at least 140% larger than the default size for body text or other primary content.

![Apple Watch Settings, displaying the default font size and the maximum font size.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/larger-text-evaluation-criteria/images/larger-text-5_2x.png)

You might also consider some of the techniques employed by the X-Large watch faces, where each complication can be set up as its own watch face, taking advantage of the full screen size. Low-vision users can still view multiple complications (including your app’s watch face complications) by swiping through each of their saved watch faces.

![Apple Watch Ultra displaying the X-Large watch face which displays a single, large complication. Low vision users can add multiple X-Large watch faces, and swipe between them to see different types of information.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/larger-text-evaluation-criteria/images/larger-text-6_2x.png)

Even after you’re able to indicate support for Larger Text in the common tasks of your app, there are likely further improvements you’ll be able to make to the accessibility of your app. Re-evaluate your app’s support for Larger Text every time you update your app. Set a goal to make your app more accessible to more people in every release.

## leaderboards

Reference

# Leaderboards

In App Store Connect, leaderboard metadata defines each leaderboard, outlines score details, and manages language-specific text for display. The platform also tracks the leaderboard type and shows the approval status, indicating if it’s live with the app.

Set these properties in the Leaderboard section of the Game Center page for an app, as described in [Manage leaderboards](/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/manage-leaderboards).

## Leaderboard properties

The main leaderboard properties identify each leaderboard in App Store Connect. These properties describe how the scores are organized and formatted.

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Reference Name | An internal name that you must provide for each leaderboard. This is the name that you use if you search for your leaderboard in App Store Connect. |
| Leaderboard ID | An alphanumeric identifier you choose for your leaderboard. This ID is limited to 100 characters (assumes single-byte characters). Note that the leaderboard ID is equivalent to the “category” in GameKit API. Your leaderboard ID is a permanent setting and therefore can’t be edited at a later date. |
| Leaderboard Description | A short description that helps players understand what they must do to rank on this leaderboard. |
| Score Format | The type of format in which you want scores for this app to be expressed in your leaderboard—for example, integer, elapsed time, or money. |
| Score Range | The score range using 64-bit signed integers. The values must be between the long min (-2^63) and long max (2^63 - 1). Any scores outside of this range are deleted. Score range values are optional, but if they’re added, both values must be set and they must not be equal. When first adding a score range, or when changing it in the future to a smaller range that will restrict data, all data outside of the range is lost and can’t be recovered. |
| Score Submission Type | The score from players to display in the leaderboard: Best Score or Most Recent Score. |
| Sort Order | The order of the score. Choose between “Low to High” and “High to Low.” Choose “Low to High” if you want lowest scores displayed first. Choose “High to Low” if you want the highest scores displayed first. |
| Start Date and Time1 | The date and time in which scores begin posting to your leaderboard. The date and time are based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). |
| Duration1 | The length of time scores on this leaderboard are posted for. |
| Restarts Interval1 | How often scores on this leaderboard are reset. |

 1This property is only available for recurring leaderboards.

## Leaderboard language properties

Leaderboard language properties collect language-specific text used in a leaderboard’s display. You must include these properties for at least one language.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Localization | The language in which your leaderboard appears. There must be at least one language defined. |
| Display Name | The display name of the leaderboard in the specified language. |
| Leaderboard Description | A short description that helps players understand what they must do to rank on this leaderboard. |
| Score Format Suffix (Singular) | This suffix is added to the end of scores displayed in the singular form. This suffix is optional but is useful for clarifying the type of score stored in the leaderboard. Examples include “point,” “coin,” and “hit.” |
| Score Format Suffix (Plural) | This suffix is added to the end of scores displayed in the plural form. This suffix is optional but is useful for clarifying the type of score stored in the leaderboard. Examples include “points,” “coins,” and “hits.” |
| Score Format | This format determines how your scores are displayed on your leaderboard for the specified language. For example, if your app is scored with money, you may want to specify different types of money based on the language you select. The score format type you set for your leaderboard will automatically apply to all languages unless you specify a different type. This is optional. |
| Image | A localized image that represents the leaderboard. The image must be a `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, or `.png` file that’s 1024 x 1024 pixels, at least 72 ppi, and in the RGB color space. This property is optional. |

## Leaderboard types

App Store Connect tracks different data for each type of leaderboard. The leaderboard type determines which scores are included in a leaderboard.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Classic | A leaderboard where score data will never reset unless the leaderboard is deleted. |
| Recurring | A recurring leaderboard will continually reset based on your preferences. |
| Combined | A leaderboard that combines and ranks together the players’ scores from multiple single leaderboards. |
| Attached | A single leaderboard that’s combined with other leaderboards—the attached child of a combined leaderboard. |

## Leaderboard statuses

Leaderboard statuses indicate whether the leaderboard has been approved and made live with the app.

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |

## localize-app-information

Manage app information

# Localize app information

After [adding an app to your account](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-a-new-app), you can add languages and localized metadata on the App Information page. Learn more about [supported languages](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-store-localizations) and [localizable properties](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/required-localizable-and-editable-properties).

For example, if you select English as the primary language for your app in App Store Connect, and it’s the only language you provide, your app metadata will appear in English in all [App Store countries or regions](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-store-localizations). If you localize your app metadata in French, the French localization displays to users whose language setting is in French. The French localization also displays to users in countries or regions where the App Store supports French but not English. Users can search for your app using localized keywords in all countries or regions where the App Store supports French. If no localization matches a user's language setting, the next most relevant localization is used. In other countries or regions, your metadata displays in the primary language (English in this example).

Languages on the App Information page in App Store Connect are part of your app's metadata. This differs from adding languages to your app in Xcode when you localize your binary. [Learn about localizing your app binary.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localization)

[Learn how to manage the localization with the App Store Connect API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/app_store/app_metadata/app_info_localizations)

**Important: **You can manage languages only when the [app status is editable](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-and-submission-statuses).

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, or Marketing. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Add a language

When you add a language to your app, screenshots and the properties for the new language default to those of the primary language, except for the description and keywords. When you add a localization from the [platform version section](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-platforms), it’s automatically added to the shared metadata under [App Information](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/view-and-edit-app-information) and to other platforms.

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. On the top right, click the primary language to display the language pop-up menu.

3. Edit the localized information, then click Save.

### Delete a language

When you delete a language, countries or regions that display app information in that language revert to showing the information entered for the primary language.

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. On the top right, click the primary language to display the language pop-up menu.
3. In the Localized section, hold the pointer over the language you want to delete and click the delete button (–).

### Change the primary language

You can change the primary language for an app. For a language to be selectable as the primary language:

- You must have already [added the language](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/localize-app-information#add-a-language) to a previous version.
- App Review must approve the new language. If the language hasn’t been approved, submit a version with this localized metadata for approval. Then, select it as your primary language in a subsequent update.
- You must have already uploaded and received App Review approval for screenshots in the language for all supported platforms. The screenshot sizes for this language must match those of your current primary language. If this localization's screenshots were previously derived from another localization, you must first manually upload new screenshots that match your current primary language's sizes and submit a version for approval. Then, change the primary language on a subsequent update. [Learn more about adding screenshots and previews.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/upload-app-previews-and-screenshots)

**Note: **If your app has a [custom product page](/help/app-store-connect/create-custom-product-pages/configure-multiple-product-page-versions) configured, you must also have uploaded screenshots in the language for each custom product page.

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the sidebar, click App Information.
3. In the Primary Language pop-up menu, choose the new primary language.

# Manage availability of iPhone and iPad apps on Apple Vision Pro

Your iPhone and iPad apps will be available to users on Apple Vision Pro unless you edit their availability in App Store Connect. These apps will run natively, using the same frameworks, resources, and runtime environment as they do on iOS and iPadOS.

Manage your app's availability

# Manage availability of iPhone and iPad apps on Macs with Apple silicon

Users running macOS 11 or later on Macs with Apple silicon can access iPhone and iPad apps through the Mac App Store, provided no edits are made to the app availability. There's no porting process since these apps use the same frameworks, resources, and runtime environments as they do on iOS and iPadOS.

When an app supports [universal purchase](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-platforms/) and already has a presence on the Mac App Store through the macOS platform, you won’t have the option to offer the iOS app on the Mac App Store. Additionally, if your iOS app is available on the Mac App Store by using this option and you later add a macOS app by adding the macOS platform in App Store Connect, releasing it to the store will replace the iOS app on the Mac App Store. Existing users of the iOS app will be updated to the macOS app.

You can choose to make your iPhone and iPad apps available, or not, on the Mac App Store for users running macOS 11 or later on Macs with Apple silicon. This is set at the app level and will apply to all versions of your app.

Apple automatically calculates the minimum macOS version using the [LSMinimumSystemVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/lsminimumsystemversion) from your build (if applicable) and the macOS version corresponding to your build's [MinimumOSVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/minimumosversion). If you’ve selected a minimum macOS version in Pricing and Availability that's higher than either the LSMinimumSystemVersion or the macOS version corresponding to the MinimumOSVersion, the version you selected will be displayed instead.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, or App Manager. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Edit availability on an individual app basis

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the sidebar, click Pricing and Availability and scroll down to the iPhone and iPad Apps on Apple Silicon Mac section.
3. Under Apple Silicon Mac Availability, deselect “Make this app available” to opt out of offering your app on the Mac App Store. Select the checkbox if you want the app to be available on the Mac App Store.

You can change the minimum macOS version required for compatibility in the menu. This selection also applies to tester groups [enabled for testing iPhone and iPad apps on Macs with Apple silicon](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/add-testers-to-builds) with TestFlight.
4. On the top right, click Save.

### Edit availability for multiple apps at a time

1. In Apps, select iOS Apps on Mac Availability from the ellipsis menu (...) in the top left.
2. In the dialog that appears, deselect the iPhone and iPad apps you don’t want to make available on the Mac App Store.
3. Click Done.

To opt out of offering any of your iPhone and iPad apps on the Mac App Store for users running macOS 11 or later on Macs with Apple silicon, click Don’t Make Available.

### Verify your app’s compatibility with Macs with Apple silicon

If your iPhone and iPad apps are compatible with Macs with Apple silicon and function as intended, verify them in App Store Connect to let users know they’ll receive a great experience on macOS. Once verified, this option will no longer be available in App Store Connect.

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the sidebar, click Pricing and Availability and scroll down to the iPhone and iPad Apps on Apple Silicon Mac section.
3. Under Compatibility with Apple Silicon Macs, click Verify Compatibility.

**Note: **Compatibility with Apple Silicon Macs isn’t available if a build has never been uploaded for the platform.
4. In the dialog that appears, click Verify.

**Note: **The Compatibility with Apple Silicon Macs section specifies whether your current and future app versions are compatible with Apple silicon Macs.

View App Analytics

# Manage campaigns

App Analytics enables you to generate campaign links for use in your marketing materials. When a user clicks an ad with your campaign link, they’re redirected to your app's product page on the App Store. Generating a campaign link also provides you with a campaign token and a provider token, which can be used in future campaigns.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, Finance, or Sales. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Create a campaign link

1. In App Analytics, select the app you want to view app.
2. In the menu bar, click Acquisition.
3. Choose Campaigns.
4. Click the add button (+) next to Campaigns.
5. In the menu, under App, select your app from the list.
6. In the Campaign field, enter a campaign name. Your campaign name is your campaign token. You can use up to 30 alphanumeric characters and spaces, and the following punctuation marks and characters:

 [ ] / \ - ~ + = <> : ; , . _ ‘ “ * & $ % # @ ? ! | { } ( )

A space can’t be used as the first or last character in the campaign token.
7. Copy the campaign link to use in your marketing materials.

Example: ` https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id123456789?pt=123456&ct=test1234&mt=8`

### Use your campaign and provider tokens

When you generate a campaign link, you also receive tokens that you can place in your other campaigns.

- Media type token (identified by the mt= parameter)
- Campaign token (identified by the ct= parameter)
- Provider token (identified with the pt= parameter)

### StoreKit

To track advertising and campaigns in apps that use the [StoreKit framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit) to load your [product page](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstoreproductviewcontroller/1620632-loadproduct), add your campaign token and provider token using [SKStoreProductParameterCampaignToken](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstoreproductparametercampaigntoken) and [SKStoreProductParameterProviderToken](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstoreproductparameterprovidertoken).

### App Store for iMessage

To direct users to your app's product page on the App Store for iMessage, add the `&app=messages` parameter to your campaign link. iMessage and sticker pack extensions share their product page with the associated iOS app.

Example: `https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id439104108?pt=8668&ct=test123&mt=8&app=messages`

### View campaign performance

In App Analytics, campaigns appear only after a minimum of 24 hours since their launch and after receiving at least five first-time downloads. Ensure your campaign includes both a provider token and a campaign token.

When a user downloads your app for the first time within 24 hours of using your campaign link or campaign token, they’re counted as a First-Time Download. If a user clicks more than one campaign link within a given timeframe, only the most recent link receives credit for subsequent sales.

1. In App Analytics, select the app you want to view.
2. Click Acquisition.
3. In the menu, on the left, choose Campaigns.
4. In the date picker, on the top-right, choose a date range. You can view a predefined period (for example, Last 7 Days) or enter a custom range. By default, the date picker will display the last 30 days.
5. On the top right, choose an App Purchase Date.

![](/help/images/icons/tips_2x.png)

Managing alternative distribution

# Manage distribution on an alternative app marketplace

If you choose to distribute your app on an alternative app marketplace, you’ll need to add the marketplace in App Store Connect.

Enter this token in App Store Connect to verify your relationship with the marketplace and add them to your account.

You can then manage which apps you want to make eligible for distribution on that marketplace, enable notifications for the marketplace, and provide the marketplace developer with the app’s alternative distribution package so they can distribute your app. You can choose to give them the alternative distribution package ID, send them the package, or set up notifications so Apple notifies them when the ID is available (if the marketplace supports notifications).

## manage-european-union-digital-services-act-trader-requirements

Manage compliance information

# Manage European Union Digital Services Act trader requirements

Articles 30 and 31 of the [Digital Services Act (DSA)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2022:277:FULL&from=EN) require Apple to verify and display trader contact information for all traders distributing apps on the App Store in the European Union (EU). This includes an address, phone number, and email address that you provide to Apple for the purpose of posting on your App Store product page in accordance with the DSA. Once verified, Apple will publish this information on your App Store product page when your app is distributed in any of the [27 territories](https://european-union.europa.eu/easy-read_en) of the EU. Even if you don’t distribute apps in the EU, you’ll still need to declare a trader status.

If you haven't already confirmed your trader status, next time you submit a new app in App Store Connect you’ll be asked to disclose whether or not you’re a trader in connection with the DSA in order to stay compliant across territories when distributing on the App Store. You'll need to confirm your trader status if you have at least one app on the App Store in the EU that qualifies you as a trader. You’ll then have the option to turn off or specify your trader status for each specific app that you distribute. If you’re not a trader, consumers in the EU will be informed that consumer rights stemming from applicable consumer protection laws won’t apply to contracts between you and them.

## Trader self-assessment

You must assess whether you're a trader for EU law purposes. If you don't distribute apps on the App Store in the EU (for example you only distribute apps through alternative distribution, or TestFlight, or on the App Store only outside the EU), you're not acting as a trader on the App Store. Apple can't determine whether you're a trader.

## How to know if you’re a trader

The DSA defines a trader as “any natural person, or any legal person irrespective of whether privately or publicly owned, who is acting, including through any person acting in his or her name or on his or her behalf, for purposes relating to his or her trade, business, craft or profession.”

The European Commission (EC) has issued a [Notice](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021XC1229(05)) on what constitutes a trader (See Section 2.2. “Concept of Trader"), though it is not specific to digital commerce. The EC has also published [Guidance](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/55e73447-8c21-4728-a42b-05bd030f7627_en?filename=Legal%20brief%203.pdf) in the digital commerce context, from the perspective of when an ”influencer“ may be considered a trader.

To determine if you're a trader, you should consider a range of non-exhaustive and non-exclusive factors (see those listed on page 2 in the EC’s Guidance), which may include:

- Whether you make revenue as a result of your app, for example if your app includes In-App Purchases, or if it's a paid or ad-sponsored app — especially if you're transacting in large volumes;
- Whether you engage in commercial practices towards consumers, including advertising, or promoting products or services;
- Whether you're registered for VAT purposes; and
- Whether you develop your app in connection with your trade, business, craft, or profession—meaning that you’re acting in a professional/business capacity. You're unlikely to be a trader for EU law purposes if you're acting “for purposes which are outside your trade, business, craft, or profession.” For example, if you're a hobbyist and you developed your app with no intention of commercializing it, you may not be considered a trader.

Regardless of whether you’re an individual developer or organization, if you have a legal status associated with a business activity, that would suggest you may be a trader.

The material contained herein is informational, general in nature, and does not constitute legal advice. If you're uncertain about your status as a trader, consult with your legal advisor.

## Information you need to provide if you're a trader

The information you need to provide depends on whether you’re enrolled in the Apple Developer Program as an individual or organization.

**Organizations:** The address associated with your D-U-N-S Number will automatically display. You’ll need to enter the following for display on your App Store product pages:

- Phone number
- Email address

This information is for display purposes only and won’t impact the information associated with your Apple Developer Program membership. If you need to update your physical address, [contact us](/contact/).

**Individuals:** You’ll need to enter the following for display on your App Store product pages:

- Address or P.O. Box
- Phone number
- Email address

This information is for display purposes only and won’t impact the information associated with your Apple Developer Program membership.

**All traders:** You’ll need to provide payment account details, if you haven’t already entered them in App Store Connect. You'll also be asked to certify that you only offer products or services that comply with the applicable rules of EU law.

## manage-groups

Configure Game Center

# Manage groups

A group must contain at least one app. Once you create a group from an app, you can add additional apps to it to share leaderboards, achievements, and challenges data. Learn how to [share activities’ data using App Store Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/creating-activities-for-your-game).

When you add an app with existing Game Center components to a group, you can choose which of those existing leaderboards, achievements, and challenges to add to the group. Once added, these components are defined in the group as they were in the app prior to being grouped. Combining these Game Center components will replace the version in the app with the one you choose from the group. App Store Connect simplifies this process by presenting only compatible components and available options at each step. The options that App Store Connect presents to you're dependent on your app and group data. Types of assets (for example, leaderboard sets) that the app doesn’t have won't display.

**Note: **

- Apps can only belong to one Game Center group. If you wish to add your app to a new group, it must be removed from any existing groups.

- If you add live leaderboards, achievements, and challenges to a group, they stay live without submitting an app version.

## Guidelines for moving achievements

There are no restrictions for adding achievements to a group; however, the following remain true:

- The maximum number of points for each achievement is 100.
- The total maximum number of points for a single app's achievements is 1000.
- There are no restrictions on the total points for all group achievements.

## Guidelines for moving challenges

Challenge can only be moved to a group with its associated leaderboard.

## manage-leaderboard-sets

Configure Game Center

# Manage leaderboard sets

Leaderboard sets organize several leaderboards into a single unit. For example, in a game that includes many levels, you could define a leaderboard set to organize the leaderboards for each level.

The limit to how many leaderboards you can create per app differs based on whether it’s with or without leaderboard sets:

Without Leaderboard sets:

- Up to 100 leaderboards per app

With Leaderboard sets:

- Up to 500 leaderboards total per app

- Maximum 100 leaderboard sets per app
- Maximum 100 leaderboards per set

You must have at least one leaderboard for your app before you can create a leaderboard set. After you add leaderboard sets to your app, all future leaderboards that you configure for the app must be included in a leaderboard set.

The process to start using leaderboard sets to organize your app’s leaderboards includes these steps:

- Create the first leaderboard set.
- Create additional leaderboard sets.
- Add new leaderboards directly into leaderboard sets.

When you create the first leaderboard set, App Store Connect ensures that all existing leaderboards for the app are included in at least one leaderboard set.

Leaderboard sets and their leaderboard must be approved before they are available to players. [Learn how to submit Game Center components for review.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-game-center-components)

- **Classic leaderboards:** A leaderboard where score data will never reset unless the leaderboard is deleted.
- **Recurring leaderboards:** A leaderboard where score data will continually be reset based on set preferences.

# Manage pricing for auto-renewable subscriptions

Auto-renewable subscriptions can be priced by App Store country or region (also known as storefronts.) You can choose from 800 price points in each currency, with the option for the Account Holder to submit a request for additional higher price points.

After you set a starting price for your auto-renewable subscription, you can schedule one future price change at a time, per country or region. If you schedule a second price change when you already have a change scheduled, the first scheduled change will be overwritten. You also have the option to preserve prices for existing subscribers.

**Note: **It may take up to 1 hour for changes you make to product metadata to appear in the sandbox environment.

### Increase the price of an auto-renewable subscription

Increases in auto-renewable subscription prices result in either a notice to active subscribers or a request for consent, based on certain criteria below. Subscribers on introductory or promotional price subscriptions, including free trials and paid offers, will renew for at least one more billing period at the price that was displayed when they subscribed, to ensure their notice or request for consent for the new price is sent at least 30 days in advance. If a subscriber doesn’t consent before the first renewal at the higher price, their subscription will expire at the end of the last billing cycle at the former price.

### Consent needed

If any of the following applies, subscribers must consent to the price increase before their next renewal date in order for the subscription to renew. * Apple will automatically contact subscribers by email or push notification to request consent.

* If you increase the price of an auto-renewable subscription in India, subscribers who have enabled UPI AutoPay must consent to the new price and have a sufficient payment balance associated with their Apple Account, or they’ll go into the billing retry state at the end of their current billing period. Apple will notify these subscribers as part of the price increase notice, but you may also wish to notify subscribers separately. Subscribers who don’t have a sufficient Apple Account balance or who wish to continue paying with UPI AutoPay must repurchase the subscription at the new price. [Learn more.](https://support.apple.com//HT212781)

* For users converting from trials or offers in South Korea, Apple will collect consent via email, in-app sheets, or push notifications. The timing and frequency of these communications may differ from those shown for standard subscription price increases. [Learn more.](https://www.ftc.go.kr/www/selectBbsNttList.do?bordCd=3&key=12&searchCtgry=01,02)

- The subscriber is located in a region that requires consent for any price changes.
- The price increase is more than 50% of the current price and the difference in price exceeds approximately US$5 per period for non-annual subscriptions, or US$50 per year for annual subscriptions. (International equivalents for prices not in USD are based on current exchange rates with specific thresholds that are subject to change based on changes in taxes or foreign exchange rates.) [View a list of thresholds per storefront.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/in-app-purchases-and-subscriptions/auto-renewable-subscription-price-increase-thresholds)
- The subscriber experienced a price increase for that subscription within the past 12 months.

The timing of price consent requests from Apple depends on the length of the subscription. If a price increase occurs within the minimum required notice period (7 days for weekly subscriptions, 27 days for 1 month subscriptions, and 30 days for subscription durations longer than 1 month), subscribers will renew at their existing price for one more billing period and will be notified before the end of their next billing period.

| Subscription duration | First email notification (email, push, in-app messaging) |
| --- | --- |
| 2 month, 3 month, and 6 month, and annual subscriptions | 60 days before renewal date |
| Monthly subscriptions | 27 days before renewal date |
| Weekly subscriptions | 7 days before renewal date |

If a subscriber doesn’t agree to the new price or takes no action, Apple will continue to request consent approximately weekly through email, push notifications, and in-app messaging until their subscription expires at the end of their current billing cycle. [Learn about displaying in-app consent messaging with StoreKit.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymentqueue/3521327-showpriceconsentifneeded)

![Example screenshots of consent needed and not](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/manage-pricing-for-auto-renewable-subscriptions/images/Consent-Not-needed_2x.png)

### Consent not needed

If none of the criteria apply, Apple will automatically notify subscribers of the price increase with no additional request for consent. Notifications are sent via email and push notifications if enabled by the subscriber 27 or 7 days before the next renewal date. On iOS 13.4 or later, Apple will also notify subscribers via in-app messaging. If a price increase occurs within the minimum required notice period, subscribers will renew at their existing price for one more billing period and will be notified before the end of their next billing period.

| First email | First in-app messaging | Push notification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 27 days before renewal date.

**Note:** Weekly subscriptions renew at the increased price on the fourth consecutive renewal. | First app launch after entering notice period. | 7 days before renewal date, if in-app messaging wasn't viewed. |

**Note: **Price changes only apply to active subscribers. If a subscription is recovered in the billing retry or grace period state, it will renew at the existing price for one more billing period. 27 days before the renewal date, the subscriber receives notice of the price change, and the subscription renews at the next renewal date at the new price. Subscribers won't receive a notification if the subscription isn't going to renew.

- **B**: Apply the price change to existing subscribers who are paying the price of your subscription currently displayed on the App Store. App Store Connect will provide an indication if consent is required (or if they'll simply be notified) for each country or region. If you have customer groups that have had their prices preserved and your change is scheduled for the future, keep in mind that circumstances may change and consent will be required based on the conditions of the customer at the time of the increase. you're responsible for ensuring you understand when consent will be required.

### FAQs

### How will changes to foreign exchange rates and tax adjustments affect auto-renewable subscription pricing?

Apple will not make price adjustments on your auto-renewable subscription products. Retail price changes initiated by Apple due to tax changes and significant foreign exchange rate movements will exclude auto-renewable subscriptions. For any value-added tax (VAT) rate changes, your proceeds and Apple’s commission will be calculated after the deduction of VAT, which means that your proceeds will change. You can choose to pass any changes caused by taxation or foreign exchange onto your subscribers by adjusting the price for your subscription.

Test In-App Purchases

# Manage Sandbox Apple Account settings

When managing Sandbox accounts, you can choose from different In-App Purchase scenarios to ensure they work as expected.

App Store Connect displays the last purchase date for active testers, or Sandbox accounts that have completed a purchase within the last 180 days. You can use filters to identify inactive testers and testers associated with a particular country or region.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, or Developer. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Edit country or region on the App Store

Each test account is associated with one of the 175 App Store storefronts. You can edit a tester's App Store country or region at any time in App Store Connect to test on different App Store storefronts using the same Sandbox account, without having to create new testers.

**Note: **All members of a Sandbox Test Family must be associated with the same App Store country or region as the family organizer. If the tester is a member of a Sandbox Test Family and you want to change their country or region, you’ll need to first remove the account from the Sandbox Test Family.

1. From Users and Access, click Sandbox to view Sandbox accounts.
2. Click the Sandbox account you want to modify.
3. Under Country or Region, make your desired change.

![Test Accounts page showing the Sandbox account detail dialog with a menu for 'country or region'.](/help/app-store-connect/test-in-app-purchases/manage-sandbox-apple-account-settings/images/edit-sandbox-country-or-region_2x.png)
4. Click Save. Once you change the country or region, the tester will need to sign in again with their Sandbox account on their iOS device to complete this change.

### Edit subscription renewal rate

The subscription renewal rate is the speed at which subscriptions renew for each tester in sandbox. The subscription renewal rate also determines the length of Billing Retry and Billing Grace Period for those testers.

You can change a tester’s subscription renewal rate at any time in their [iOS Sandbox Account Settings](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/testing_in-app_purchases_with_sandbox) or by following these steps in App Store Connect:

1. From Users and Access, click Sandbox to view Sandbox accounts.
2. Click the Sandbox account you want to modify.
3. In the dialog that appears under Subscription Renewal Rate, select a renewal speed and click Save.

By default, accounts are set to a speed equalization of 1 month = 5 minutes. You can slow down or speed up the renewal period using the options below. Subscriptions automatically renew up to 12 times before auto-renewal turns off on the thirteenth renewal attempt. Note that the speed of renewal in sandbox depends on the length of the subscription.

![Test Accounts page showing the Sandbox account detail dialog with a menu for 'subscription renewal rate'.](/help/app-store-connect/test-in-app-purchases/manage-sandbox-apple-account-settings/images/edit-sandbox-renewal-rate_2x.png)

### Enable interrupted purchases for a Sandbox account

You can test interrupted purchase scenarios on a device running iOS 14 or later by enabling interrupted purchases for a specific Sandbox account. An interrupted purchase is experienced anytime a customer tries to complete an App Store transaction but needs to perform an action outside of your app first. For example, they may need to agree to updated terms and conditions or update an expired payment method.

You can enable or disable interrupted purchases for a tester at any time in their [iOS Sandbox Account Settings](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/testing_in-app_purchases_with_sandbox)  or by following these steps in App Store Connect:

4. Click Save.

Once interrupted purchases are enabled, on-device purchase attempts by that Sandbox account will be interrupted in the sandbox environment and continue to be interrupted until the option is deselected or the tester agrees to terms and conditions on their iOS device.

### Clear Sandbox account purchase history

You can clear the purchase history for a tester to continue testing with the same Sandbox account. Clearing purchase history deletes all past purchases made by the selected testers in the sandbox environment. This action can’t be reversed. Customer accounts aren’t affected.

You can clear a tester’s purchase history at any time in their [iOS Sandbox Account Settings](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/testing_in-app_purchases_with_sandbox)  or by following these steps in App Store Connect:

1. From Users and Access, click Sandbox to view Sandbox accounts.

If your subscription offers contingent pricing or [win-back offers](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/set-up-win-back-offers), you have the option to disable streamlined purchasing for your app. Streamlined purchasing allows customers to purchase auto-renewable subscriptions directly from the App Store.

Streamlined purchasing is enabled by default. If your subscription requires steps at the time of purchase, such as signing into the app, you can choose to turn off streamlined purchasing. When turned off, customers will have to go into your app to complete subscription purchases.

Before you can turn off streamlined purchasing, your latest approved binary must include the necessary [StoreKit APIs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/purchaseintent). Turning off streamlined purchasing will apply to subscriptions merchandised on the App Store like Contingent Pricing and Win-back Offers. It doesn’t apply to the subscription offer codes or In-App Purchase promo codes redemptions from the App Store or redemption URL.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, or Marketing. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

To turn on or turn off Streamlined Purchasing:

1. From Apps, select your app.
2. In the sidebar, click Subscriptions.
3. Choose the subscription group containing your subscription.
4. Click the subscription you wish to edit.
5. Scroll down to Streamlined Purchasing and click Edit.
6. Streamlined purchasing is on by default. Turning it off will require your latest approved binary to include the necessary [StoreKit APIs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/purchaseintent).

# Manage webhooks

You can optionally configure webhooks in App Store Connect to receive automatic notifications to your web server when there are updates or changes to your apps, such as: 

- The [status of a build upload](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-uploads/build-upload-statuses) changes.
- The [status of a beta build](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-uploads/app-build-statuses) changes.
- The [status of an app version](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-and-submission-statuses#app-statuses) changes.
- The [status of an Apple-hosted asset pack version](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-uploads/apple-hosted-asset-pack-statuses) changes.
- New [TestFlight feedback](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/view-tester-feedback) is submitted by a tester.

If you’re the developer of an [alternative app marketplace](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/marketplacekit/creating-an-alternative-app-marketplace), you can also configure webhooks in App Store Connect to receive automatic notifications to your web server when there are updates or changes to the apps that your marketplace distributes. [Learn about recent changes to alternative distribution notifications.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/app-store-connect-api-4-2-release-notes)

To receive these notifications, implement an endpoint on your web server, or *webhook*.

A webhook can only apply to one app, and you can create up to ten webhooks per app.

Learn more about [webhook event types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/webhook-events) and [how to manage webhooks using the App Store Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/configuring-webhook-notifications).

## measure-your-first-annual-installs

Understanding the Core Technology Fee

# Measure your first annual installs

If you have accepted the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU (available for apps in the European Union), you'll begin accumulating first annual installs for your EU apps.

Use the following two reports to monitor how many first annual installs your apps receive. If any of your apps exceed one million first annual installs, or if you're distributing an app marketplace, you’ll also receive monthly financial reports which will inform you of the amount owed. Nonprofit organizations, accredited educational institutions, and government entities who are approved for a [fee waiver](/support/fee-waiver/) will also receive the first annual install reports but not the financial report since they are exempt from the Core Technology Fee, subject to the Apple Developer Program’s existing rules.

If you have not signed the Alternative Terms Addendum, you can use App Install Reports from 2023 to [estimate your Core Technology Fee](/help/app-store-connect/understanding-the-core-technology-fee/estimate-fees-for-alternative-business-terms).

### FAQs

### How does Apple know how many installs my apps are getting?

Apple provides secure installation APIs that can be called by the App Store, web distribution developers, or alternative app marketplaces to request the installation of iOS and iPadOS apps. This API, along with a signal when the installation is complete, enables Apple to accurately count how many times an app is installed.

### How will Apple protect developers from install spam?

Apple already takes a number of steps to prevent fraud and scams and protect developers’ intellectual property. Apple is implementing additional measures to monitor, detect, and prevent install abuse, including:

- An install verification mechanism to ensure that all installs come from real Apple devices.
- Limits on the number of first annual installs that can come from a single device.
- Investigating, and potentially terminating, user or developer accounts that engage in suspicious behavior.

If a developer believes that their app’s install count was inflated by install spam, they’ll be able to [contact us](/support/).

# Nominations template

To bulk import nomination entries into App Store Connect, use the provided CSV template. This template is available for download when selecting the option to [import multiple nominations](/help/app-store-connect/manage-featuring-nominations/nominate-your-app-for-featuring#import-multiple-nominations-into-app-store-connect). You can submit up to 50 nominations at a time with CSV file.

If your import encounters any errors, you'll receive an alert message in App Store Connect. Download the report to address the errors and re-upload the corrected .csv file. Error details will be listed in an additional column in the file. After fixing the errors and re-uploading the file to App Store Connect, click Submit. You can view your nominations on the Featuring Nominations page in the table under Submitted.

Make sure to submit and finalize your plan at least three weeks in advance. It'll be reviewed with certain considerations in mind and if it’s a fit, we'll reach out to the email address you provide.

Keep in mind, the information you provide will be used to evaluate your app for featuring opportunities.

**Additional notes:**

- Keep the template exactly as provided. Any changes to the columns (such as deleting, adding, or renaming them) will cause the CSV import to fail.

## offer-auto-renewable-subscriptions

Manage subscriptions

# Offer auto-renewable subscriptions

App Store Connect offers tools to help you run a subscription business on the App Store. How you configure your subscriptions in App Store Connect determine how users subscribe to your service, how often they are billed, and how they upgrade and downgrade between offerings. To begin offering a subscription in your app, you will need to create a Subscription Group, then add one or more Subscription products to that group, then assign levels to those products. Subscription setup is structured as the following:

- **Subscription group:** A set of subscription products with varying levels and durations. You can have up to 100 subscriptions per group. Users can subscribe to one subscription product per group at a time.
- **Subscription: **A product that lets users purchase dynamic content for a set period. Auto-renewable subscriptions renew automatically, unless cancelled by the user. Subscription duration and price is configured in App Store Connect.
- **Subscription levels:** A ranking system of subscriptions within a subscription group that determines the upgrade, downgrade, and crossgrade path available to subscribers. Levels make it possible to offer varying access (basic, premium) of the same service.
- **Subscription duration: **The length of time before the subscription renews and the subscriber is charged. Possible durations are 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

## Single subscription product setup

If you offer only one subscription product in your app, the subscription defaults to a single level within the subscription group.

![MacBook Pro screen with a subscription page for an app called Ocean Journal. The page shows the App Store Connect navigation menu at the top and the Subscriptions page below with one available subscription option listed.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/offer-auto-renewable-subscriptions/images/InApp-OfferAutoRenew-Single_2x.png)

## Multiple subscription and durations product setup

Arrange your subscriptions in order from the one that offers the most (level 1) to the one that offers the least. You can stack subscriptions with equal content but different durations and other similar variables, at the same level. Each level can have multiple subscription products, offering multiple durations and prices for people to choose from. This lets them upgrade, downgrade, and crossgrade within the subscription group without impacting their days of paid service.

![A MacBook Pro screen and a mobile phone screen. The screens show a subscription page for an app called Ocean Journal. The page shows the App Store Connect navigation menu at the top and the Subscriptions page below with one available subscription option listed.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/offer-auto-renewable-subscriptions/images/InApp-OfferAutoRenew-Multi_2x.png)

## Subscription proceeds rate

During a subscriber’s first year of service, you receive 70% of the subscription price at each billing cycle, minus applicable taxes. After a subscriber accumulates one year of paid service in the same subscription group, your net revenue increases to 85% of the subscription price, minus applicable taxes. Time spent within a subscription offer is also counted toward the total. Members of the [App Store Small Business Program](/app-store/small-business-program/) receive 85% starting on the first day.

When an auto-renewable subscription expires, the days of paid service stop accumulating. If someone resubscribes or the subscription is recovered within 60 days, the days of paid service continue from the recovery date. Conversely, if the subscription is recovered after 60 days, the rate reverts to 70% and the day count starts over.

When a subscription expires due to a billing issue, Apple attempts to renew the subscription and collect payment. If you enabled the billing grace period for your apps, there won’t be any interruption to days of paid service or to your revenue, if Apple is able to recover the subscription within the billing grace period (either 6 or 16 days, depending on the subscription duration). [Learn more about billing grace periods.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/enable-billing-grace-period-for-auto-renewable-subscriptions)

You can find information about subscription performance, subscriber activity, and proceeds in your Sales and Trends reports. [Learn more](/help/app-store-connect/view-sales-and-trends/view-subscription-data).

**Note: **It may take up to 1 hour for changes you make to product metadata to appear in the sandbox environment.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, Developer, or Marketing. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Create a subscription group

To offer subscriptions within your app, you must first create a subscription group in App Store Connect. When you create subscription products, you'll be able to add these products to the subscriptions group. Before creating subscriptions, ensure that you understand the right subscription setup for your business model. [Learn about offering subscriptions.](/app-store/subscriptions/)

1. In the sidebar, under Monetization, click Subscriptions.
2. Click the add button (+).
3. Enter a reference name.

A single subscription group is currently listed in the section.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/offer-auto-renewable-subscriptions/images/InApp-subscriptions-mainpg_2x.png)

### Create an additional subscription group

If you want to offer groups of subscriptions with varying subscription levels, you’ll need to create more than one subscription group.

**Note: **Since users can only buy one subscription within a group at a time, creating a single group is the best practice for most apps, as it prevents people from accidentally purchasing multiple subscriptions. Users who buy subscriptions in multiple groups are billed separately for each subscription.

1. In the sidebar, under Monetization, click Subscriptions.
2. Click the add button (+).
3. Read and acknowledge the warning by selecting the checkbox and clicking Next.

**Note: **You’ll only be prompted with a warning when creating your second subscription group.

![Screenshot of Create an Additional Subscription Group? pop-up window. A checkbox labeled 'I understand, create additional subscription group' is selected. Buttons for navigation include Cancel and Next.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/offer-auto-renewable-subscriptions/images/InApp-Subs-addsub-checkbox_2x.png)

4. Enter the subscription’s reference name and Product ID, then click Create. Once you've created your subscription product, you'll be taken to its information page to add more details.

![Screenshot of a Create Subscription pop-up window. There are fields to enter a reference name and product ID. Buttons for navigation include Cancel and Create.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/offer-auto-renewable-subscriptions/images/InApp-Subscription-CreateNew2_2x.png)
5. Under Subscription Duration, choose a duration and click Save.

![Screenshot of a Create Subscription pop-up window. A dropdown menu for Subscription Duration is open, displaying a list of duration options.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/offer-auto-renewable-subscriptions/images/InApp-Subscription-CreateNew3_2x.png)

9. Click Save.

**Note:** If you'd like your subscription to be accessible from more than one app, create an equivalent subscription product for each app. [Learn how to offer subscriptions across multiple apps](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/offering_a_subscription_across_multiple_apps).

### Assign subscription levels

Once you create a subscription product, you can add subscription group information and set subscription levels. These levels determine the upgrades, downgrades, and crossgrades available within a group.

You don’t have to assign multiple levels. You can choose to offer a single subscription product or offer multiple subscription products and assign them all to the same level within a group.

1. In the left sidebar, click In-App Events.
2. Select your event from the list.
3. In the Country or Region Availability section, click Customize Dates and Times.
4. Select the locations you want to edit, and click Next.
5. Enter the start date and time. Use the Time Zone toggle on the top right to choose a timezone.
6. Click Done.
7. To customize more regions, click the add button (+) next to Customize Dates and Times.
8. Select the locations you want to edit, and click Next.
9. Enter the start date and time.
10. Click Done.

### Add additional information

1. Provide an event deep link. This link takes users who tap Open on the In-App Event card or details page to the event content within your app. This can be a universal link (recommended for security) or custom URL. Avoid using URL shorteners and other services that add unnecessary redirects. Test the deep link to make sure it directs to the proper destination within your app — for example, you can paste your URL into the Notes app and tap it. [Learn about configuring universal links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content).
2. Select the general purpose of your event to help make sure your event reaches the most relevant users on the App Store and Apple Games.
3. Select the priority for your event. Events appear chronologically on the product page based on start time, with the soonest start time displaying first. If you designate an event as High Priority, it will appear ahead of Normal Priority events.
4. Indicate if an In-App Purchase is required to participate in the event, as this information is shown on your event details page. For subscription apps, you only need to indicate that an In-App Purchase is required when there’s an additional cost for the event specifically — for example, a pay-per-view event in a subscription app that requires an In-App Purchase in addition to the standard subscription.
5. Choose your event’s primary language. This will be the default language that displays to users if your event isn’t localized for their device’s language.

Reference

# On-demand resources size limits

*On-demand resources* are app contents that are hosted on the App Store and are separate from the related app bundle that you download. They enable smaller app bundle, faster downloads, and richer app content.

**Note: **On-demand resources is a legacy technology, so migrating to [Background Assets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundassets) is recommended.

There are limits on the amount of storage used by on-demand resources for when you upload your app to App Store Connect or while the app is running.

**Note: **macOS and watchOS don't support on-demand resources.

### On-demand resource sizes

The table below outlines the variant size limits for each deployment target after app thinning. For example, the total size limit of each asset pack is 8GB after thinning for apps available on devices running iOS 18 and later.

## overview-for-configuring-in-app-purchases

Configure In-App Purchase settings

# Overview for configuring In-App Purchases

In-App Purchases let you offer extra content and features in your apps distributed on the App Store — including digital goods, subscriptions, and premium content — directly within your app on all Apple platforms. To make an In-App Purchase available in multiple platform versions of your app, create a single In-App Purchase under the Distribution tab in App Store Connect, then use [StoreKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/) to implement the In-App Purchase in the various platform versions of your app.

**Note: **It may take up to 1 hour for changes you make to product metadata to appear in the sandbox environment.

There are four types of In-App Purchases:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Consumable | A product that is used once, after which it becomes depleted and must be purchased again. Example: fish food in a fishing app. |
| Non-consumable | A product that is purchased once and does not expire or decrease with use. Example: race track for a game app. |
| Auto-renewable subscriptions | A product that allows users to purchase dynamic content for a set period. This type of Subscription renews automatically unless canceled by the user. Example: Monthly subscriptions for an app offering streaming services. |
| Non-renewing subscriptions | A product that allows users to access content for a limited duration of time. This type of Subscription does not renew automatically. Example: One year subscription to view live gaming content. |

You can create up to 10,000 In-App Purchase products per app. Every In-App Purchase must be associated with an app and can be shared across multiple platform versions (iOS, macOS, tvOS). In-App Purchases are not shareable between different apps.

Implementing In-App Purchases in your app requires configuration between your apps’ server and Apple’s servers, as well as set up and ongoing management in App Store Connect. The following workflow can be used:

1. **Accept the Paid Apps Agreement**

To offer In-App Purchases, the membership Account Holder must [accept the Paid Apps Agreement](/help/app-store-connect/manage-agreements/sign-and-update-agreements) in the Business section of App Store Connect.
2. **Design your In-App Purchase**

To ensure your In-App Purchase experience fits well with the rest of your app and effectively showcases your products, review the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/technologies/in-app-purchase) and [App Review Guidelines](/app-store/review/guidelines/).
3. **Configure In-App Purchases in App Store Connect**

[Create In-App Purchases](/help/app-store-connect/manage-consumable-and-non-consumable-in-app-purchases/create-in-app-purchases) and add metadata, such as product name, description, price, and availability. You’ll also need to [generate In-App Purchase keys](/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/generate-keys-for-in-app-purchases) and [set a tax category](/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/set-a-tax-category-for-in-app-purchases), which will allow Apple to calculate the appropriate tax on customer transactions.
4. **Implement StoreKit**

Add the [In-App Purchase capability](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-capabilities-to-your-app) to your app in Xcode, ensure that the bundle identifier and product identifiers in Xcode match the identifiers for your app and In-App Purchases in App Store Connect.
5. **Test your In-App Purchases**

Apple provides a testing environment, called sandbox, which allows you to [test In-App Purchases](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/testing_at_all_stages_of_development_with_xcode_and_the_sandbox) without incurring charges using [test accounts](/help/app-store-connect/test-in-app-purchases/create-a-sandbox-apple-account). Test each part of your code to verify that you’ve implemented it correctly by using your app to make In-App Purchases.

You can further test your app and In-App Purchases using either [TestFlight](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/testflight-overview), or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode).
6. **Use App Store Server Notifications**

[App Store Server Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreservernotifications) provide near real-time updates about transaction status and key events related to In-App Purchases, such as a refund or a change in subscription status or Family Sharing access. To leverage these notifications, you’ll need to [enter URLs for your production and sandbox server environments](/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/enter-server-urls-for-app-store-server-notifications) in App Store Connect.
7. **Submit your In-App Purchases for review**

Before you publish your In-App Purchase on the App Store it must be [submitted for review](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/overview-of-submitting-for-review). If you’re submitting your first In-App Purchase, you must submit it with a new version of your app. Ensure you aren't missing any [required information](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/required-localizable-and-editable-properties) before submitting. Monitor [In-App Purchase statuses](/help/app-store-connect/reference/in-app-purchases-and-subscriptions/in-app-purchase-statuses) to understand if your In-App Purchase is available or if it needs your attention.

## overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels

Manage app accessibility

# Overview of Accessibility Nutrition Labels

The Accessibility Nutrition Labels help users learn if an app will be accessible to them before they download, and give developers the opportunity to better inform and educate their users on features that their app supports. The labels appear on the app product page and will help users understand if they can use a feature like VoiceOver or Larger Text to complete common tasks in the app.

In order to give you time to prepare and evaluate your apps, providing these labels will be voluntary to start. However, you’re encouraged to report your accessibility support to help everyone, including people with disabilities, better discover apps that fit their needs. You’ll be given ample time and evaluation resources before this is mandatory, but over time, you’ll be required to share accessibility support details to submit new apps and app updates to the App Store.

## Types of Accessibility Features

Below are the accessibility features you can provide Accessibility Nutrition Labels for. We recommend that you evaluate your features in this order. Most of the work that goes into making your app accessible to VoiceOver users, for example, can also make it more accessible for users of other assistive technologies, like Voice Control and more.

Some accessibility labels aren’t available on some devices, as indicated in the table below, so you’ll be prompted to indicate support only for the accessibility features that are applicable to each device in App Store Connect.

![Screenshot of the Accessibility section of an app's detail page in the App Store, which lists supported accessibility features.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels/images/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels-2_2x.png)

![Screenshot of the Accessibility details page for an app in the App Store, listing its supported accessibility features.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels/images/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels-1_2x.png)

| Accessibility feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [VoiceOver](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/voiceover-evaluation-criteria) | Users can navigate and explore the app using gestures, keyboard, braille, and speech output. |
| [Voice Control](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/voice-control-evaluation-criteria) | Users can navigate and interact with the app using their voice to tap, swipe, click, type, and more. This isn't supported on Apple TV and Apple Watch. |
| [Larger Text](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/larger-text-evaluation-criteria) | Increases the text size in the app to 200% or more. This isn't supported on Mac and Apple TV. |
| [Dark Interface](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/dark-interface-evaluation-criteria) | Applies a dark color scheme to the screens, menus, and controls to reduce eye strain. |
| [Differentiate Without Color Alone](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/differentiate-without-color-alone-evaluation-criteria) | Uses shapes or text, in addition to or instead of color, to distinguish key information. |
| [Sufficient Contrast](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/sufficient-contrast-evaluation-criteria) | Increases or adjusts the contrast between text or iconography and background. |
| [Reduced Motion](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/reduced-motion-evaluation-criteria) | Modifies or reduces certain types of animation that may cause motion sickness or discomfort. |
| [Captions](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/captions-evaluation-criteria) | Users can follow the dialog and relevant sounds of video or audio-only content with time-synchronized text. |
| [Audio Descriptions](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/audio-descriptions-evaluation-criteria) | Users can hear audio descriptions of video content in a clip, show, or movie with time-synchronized narration. |

## Discovery on the App Store

The Accessibility Nutrition Labels will appear on your app’s product page in all countries or regions where your app is available. The App Store displays the labels specific to the device type (iPhone, Mac, etc.) used to view your product page.

**Note: **The Accessibility Nutrition Labels will appear on Apple devices running iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and watchOS 26 or later.

You have the option to provide information for each device your app supports in App Store Connect. If you don’t provide this information for a device, the section will still appear on your product page and show that you haven’t indicated support yet. This section will also indicate if your app supports none of these accessibility features.

You also have the option to provide an accessibility URL that links to your website so that users can learn more about the app’s accessibility features. This link will show on your app's product page across all devices, except Apple TV. This accessibility URL should correspond uniquely to your app and can include information such as other accessibility features, how to turn on and manage any in-app accessibility settings, what languages are supported in captions, or areas of your app that don’t support an accessibility feature.

Users can include Accessibility Nutrition Label features as part of their search query to make their results more relevant. For example, in searches like “VoiceOver note taking apps” or “running apps with Larger Text,” apps that have indicated support for those features in their labels will be considered more relevant in search results.

## Planning for your responses

To encourage developers to respond consistently across all apps, the App Store has set evaluation criteria a developer should meet before indicating support in the Accessibility Nutrition Labels.

Before providing your responses in App Store Connect, you’ll need to audit your app to understand the level of support it provides and how it aligns to the App Store’s standards for each accessibility feature. Since your app’s support of an accessibility feature can differ per device and you can provide responses for each device in App Store Connect, you should assess your app on each of the devices your app supports.

To indicate support for an accessibility feature in the Accessibility Nutrition Labels, users must be able to complete all of the common tasks of your app using that feature.

In addition to following the evaluation criteria, make sure to follow [App Review Guideline 2.3](/app-store/review/guidelines/#performance) for accurate metadata. If an app potentially has intentionally misleading or harmful accessibility labels, App Review has the ability to contact the developer and ask them to update their Accessibility Nutrition Labels.

You’re responsible for keeping your responses accurate and up-to-date. If your practices change, please [update your responses](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/manage-accessibility-nutrition-labels#update-your-apps-accessibility-support).

### Identifying the common tasks in your app

To indicate support of an accessibility feature in the Accessibility Nutrition Labels, users should be able to complete all of the common tasks of your app using that feature. Before you begin evaluating features, compile a list of the common tasks that a person can perform in your app.

**Common tasks checklist**

Common tasks consist of the primary functionality that you expect users to perform in your app, plus functionality that's fundamental to using an app in general: first launch experience, login, purchase, and settings.

- **Primary functionality specific to your app**

- To indicate support for an accessibility feature, a user should be able to perceive, operate, and understand all of the primary functionality specific to your app while using the feature.
- To come up with your list of primary functionality, start by defining the key goals, functionality, and features users download and use your app for. It may be helpful to consider what you market in your app’s description, screenshots, and app previews.

As an example, a to-do list app’s common tasks will include these tasks below.

- View task list

- The user may need to mark a task as complete, undo marking a task as complete, change the due date, or create a new task.
- Task detail view

- For a new or existing task, the user may need to enter information about the task, save the task to a list, or exit the screen without making modifications.
- **First launch experience**

- To indicate support for an accessibility feature, a user should be able to complete the app’s first launch experience while using the accessibility feature. For example, your first launch experience may have a video with sound that you may want to express in captions, or an onboarding flow that a user should be able to complete or skip.
- **Login**

- To indicate support for an accessibility feature, a user should be able to complete the login experience while using the accessibility feature. For example, the user should be able to choose a login service, enter a username and password, interact with a login button, request a password reset, or enter information to create a new account.
- **Purchase**

- If your app offers purchases, to indicate support for an accessibility feature, a user should be able to complete the purchase experience while using the accessibility feature. For example, the user should be able to select a payment provider, enter a credit card number, review the terms of an offer, or review before completing the purchase.
- **Settings**

- To indicate support for an accessibility feature, a user should be able to adjust app settings while using the accessibility feature. For example, the user should be able to turn on accessibility or privacy features, manage purchases, or exit the settings screen without modifying settings.

**Ensuring a comprehensive list**

As you make your list, consider the following to ensure you have a comprehensive list of common tasks:

- Make sure your list includes common tasks that users both with and without disabilities can perform.
- Consider differences by device, such as if a certain experience is only available on Apple Watch but not Mac.
- Include tasks that you make mandatory to use your app, such as account sign-up or purchasing a subscription.
- Especially for new users, consider default and loading screens, such as the screen to view the task list when the user hasn’t added tasks yet.
- Consider actions a user can take outside your app that are common tasks, such as marking a task complete in a notification or widget from your to-do list app.
- When evaluating, you're not required to consider tasks that are uncommon in your app. If you're unsure if a task is common, ask yourself whether you'd ship an urgent fix if users were blocked from completing this task. For example, if your app provides links to your app’s marketing channels on social media and web but that isn’t a key goal of using the app, you're not required to include it in your evaluation. If you want to provide more information about the accessibility of uncommon tasks, use the accessibility URL to do so.

**Recommended: Create an accessibility testing matrix**

After you identify your app’s common tasks, to guide your evaluation, it may be helpful to create an accessibility testing matrix for each device you plan to provide Accessibility Nutrition Labels for in App Store Connect. Following this matrix isn’t required, but it can help make sure you’re validating that all common tasks can be completed for an accessibility feature on that device. This is especially helpful since some of your app’s common tasks may not be available on some devices, and some accessibility features aren’t available on certain devices.

To start, create a matrix for each device you’ll be evaluating for Accessibility Nutrition Labels.

For each matrix, take the common tasks that are available on that device, and add them as rows. For example, if a common task is only available on Mac but not Apple Watch, include the common task in your matrix for Mac but not your matrix for Apple Watch.

Next, consider the accessibility features you want to evaluate. Since some accessibility features aren’t available on certain devices, you won’t be able to provide Accessibility Nutrition Labels for them. Take the [accessibility features that are available on that device](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels#type-of-labels), and add them as columns.

Now you're ready to evaluate your app.

## Tips

**Implementation**

- Whenever possible, use the Apple-provided native API to reduce implementation complexity and so customers who have turned on the system setting will automatically get this experience without an additional setting. We highly recommend Apple-provided native APIs for complex app behaviors, such as drag and drop or multi-touch gestures.
- Provide native support for core assistive technologies, including VoiceOver and Voice Control. These assistive technologies allow connection to hardware interfaces, such as braille displays, and interaction with operating system features, like app switching, that your app otherwise wouldn’t be able to support. Don’t attempt to make a custom implementation of the functionality provided by core assistive technologies like VoiceOver or Voice Control.
- With the exception of core assistive technologies like VoiceOver and Voice Control, you may use a custom implementation to indicate support for your labels, such as a custom dark color scheme, instead of using the system’s standard dark appearance.
- Even if you use a custom implementation for an accessibility feature, consider leveraging the user’s system setting to ensure your app responds to their needs. For example, if you render custom captions in a game, check the user’s system setting that indicates a need or preference for displaying captions when available. If you offer your own in-app setting, it should offer more granular user interface customization than the system setting provides.
- Pay extra attention to custom elements, since they are less likely than standard elements to have accommodations for accessible experiences. Additionally, some custom elements may require additional work to support features like VoiceOver and Voice Control.

**Third-party content**

- You don’t have to consider third-party or user-generated content when evaluating accessibility labels if those views aren’t part of your common tasks.
- When third-party or user-generated content views *are* part of your common tasks, you don’t need to ensure all third-party content is accessible, but your app should provide the third-party content creators a reasonable, discoverable way to make their content accessible. For example:

- In most video streaming apps, developers support a way to display closed captions, even though not all third-party movie and television studios provide captions with their video content.
- In apps that allow users to upload images, developers should provide a way for the users to label the image, so the image content is perceivable to VoiceOver users.
- In apps that use a web view to load third-party websites, WebKit provides default support for most accessibility labels for web content by using web standards like HTML, CSS, and ARIA.
- In addition, web browsers like Safari provide additional accessibility features, like site-specific font size settings, which allow users to enlarge the font sizes of web sites to 200% the default size, or sometimes larger.

**Best practices**

- The common guiding principles of accessibility are that content, controls, and interfaces should be *perceivable*, *operable*, *understandable*, and *robust*. Keep these principles in mind as you’re evaluating your app. For example, a blind VoiceOver user should be able to *perceive* the content of a visual photograph or icon, often by experiencing its text alternative label as speech or braille. Likewise, if most users can operate an item by tapping, clicking, or dragging it, the item should also be *operable* to assistive technologies like VoiceOver and Voice Control, so that users with disabilities can use all the same functions of an app.
- You may consider exceptions to the recommendations here if users with disabilities would find them reasonable. For example, you might hide a button from VoiceOver in one view if it duplicates functionality that’s already available and discoverable elsewhere.

## Additional guidance

**Your app has bugs that affect its accessibility.**

If bugs are significant enough to change your answer according to the Accessibility Nutrition Labels evaluation criteria, then don’t indicate support for the accessibility feature. To avoid misleading users, you shouldn’t enter answers that aren’t aligned with the evaluation criteria.

**An accessibility feature doesn't apply to your app.**

Review the evaluation criteria for the accessibility feature to determine if it's applicable and whether to indicate support.

**You have additional accessibility information to share with users.**

Add an [accessibility URL](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/manage-accessibility-nutrition-labels#manage-the-accessibility-url) to your product page to provide users additional accessibility information, such as other accessibility features, how to turn on and manage any in-app accessibility settings, what languages are supported in captions, or areas of your app that don’t support an accessibility feature feature.

**Your app includes app extensions.**

Your app may include app extensions such as stickers, custom keyboards, Safari extensions, or photo editing extensions. To determine whether to include app extensions in your evaluation, determine whether they are part of your app’s common tasks. If using the app extension isn't part of your app’s primary functionality, then it's unlikely to be one of your app’s common tasks.

**Your app has advertising.**

Include advertising in your evaluation if it’s present in the UI when users are completing your app’s common tasks. If the advertising experience prevents users from completing a common task using an accessibility feature (for example, the advertisement contains problematic motion that can't be addressed by a system or in-app setting to reduce motion), then don’t indicate support for the feature.

**Your app is a compatible iPhone and iPad app on Apple Vision Pro.**

If your [iPhone and iPad app is compatible with and can run on Apple Vision Pro](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/manage-availability-of-iphone-and-ipad-apps-on-apple-vision-pro/), no responses are needed for Apple Vision Pro. The labels for iPhone or iPad will be shown to users on the Apple Vision Pro App Store.

**Your app is a compatible iPhone and iPad app on Macs with Apple silicon.**

If your [iPhone and iPad app is compatible with and can run on Macs with Apple silicon](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/manage-availability-of-iphone-and-ipad-apps-on-macs-with-apple-silicon), no responses are needed for Mac. The labels for iPhone or iPad will be shown to users on the Mac App Store.

At Apple, we believe that the best technology works for everyone to help them connect, create, play, and do what they love in the ways that work best for them. Even after you’re able to claim support for an accessibility feature in the *common* tasks of your app, there are likely further improvements you’ll be able to make to the accessibility of your app. Can *all users* use *all features* of the app, not just the *common tasks*? While it’s not required, we encourage you to go beyond this criteria to provide the most accessible experience you can for all users.

Offer App Clip experiences

# Overview of App Clips

An App Clip is a small part of your app that’s discoverable at the moment it’s needed and lets people quickly start and finish a task from your app. Users running iOS 14 or later can quickly access App Clips without needing to download the full app. [Learn about App Clips](/app-clips/).

**Note: **App Clips are subject to the same [age restrictions](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/set-an-app-age-rating/) and [parental controls](https://support.apple.com/105121) as full apps. However, App Clips aren’t available to children under 13 or those with [Ask to Buy](https://support.apple.com/105055) enabled, regardless of other restrictions and settings. To access all of an app’s features, such as those normally offered through [App Clip codes](/help/app-store-connect/offer-app-clip-experiences/generate-app-clip-codes) and [QR codes](/help/app-store-connect/offer-app-clip-experiences/offer-a-default-app-clip-experience), these users must install the full app.

You can configure how your App Clip is discovered and launched by creating App Clip experiences. Each experience includes metadata for the App Clip card, an invocation URL, and various invocation methods. You can create many App Clip experiences to support situations when different tasks from your app might be helpful.

A default App Clip experience is required and can be invoked using Safari and Messages, as well as through an NFC tag, QR code, and links in other apps when using an Apple-provided App Clip link.

You can also create advanced App Clip experiences, which let you configure your App Clip to use multiple domains, associate your App Clip with physical locations, and customize multiple App Clip cards to represent different businesses with a single App Clip. [Learn about configuration options.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/configuring_your_app_clip_s_launch_experience)

When you’re ready to submit your app for review to distribute on the App Store, you can optionally provide up to three URLs that are representative of experiences your App Clip provides, allowing App Review to understand the features and functionalities. Add these URLs in the App Clips URLs section in App Review Information toward the bottom of the Version Information page.

To edit the App Clip section in App Store Connect, you must first upload a build that includes an App Clip. Ensure that each subsequent app version you submit includes the App Clip to maintain its availability for users.

## overview-of-app-transfer

Transfer an app

# Overview of app transfer

You’ll need to transfer the ownership of an app when you’ve sold the app to another developer or you want to move it to another App Store Connect account or organization.

You can transfer your app while keeping it available for download on the App Store. During and after the transfer, the app retains its reviews and ratings, and users continue to receive updates. When an app is transferred it maintains its Bundle ID, which can’t be changed once a build has been uploaded for the app.

### 1: Verify that the app can be transferred

The app must meet all [app transfer criteria](/help/app-store-connect/transfer-an-app/app-transfer-criteria) to be transferable.

### 2: Back up all app information

Because an app is removed from your account after an app transfer, you should back up all information about the app before you transfer it.

### 3: Initiate the app transfer

Your membership Account Holder initiates the app transfer. [Learn more.](/help/app-store-connect/transfer-an-app/initiate-an-app-transfer)

### 4: Accept the app transfer

The receiving Account Holder accepts the app transfer. [Learn more.](/help/app-store-connect/transfer-an-app/accept-an-app-transfer)

### Apps using auto-renewable subscriptions

Apps that offer auto-renewable subscriptions must use an app-specific shared secret.

- **Initiate an app transfer**

Before initiating a transfer for an app that offers auto-renewable subscriptions, [generate an app-specific shared secret](/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/generate-a-shared-secret-to-verify-receipts). Then, share the code with the user of the developer account you're transferring the app to. After sharing the code, [initiate the app transfer](/help/app-store-connect/transfer-an-app/initiate-an-app-transfer).
- **Accept an app transfer**

Before you [accept an app transfer](/help/app-store-connect/transfer-an-app/accept-an-app-transfer) for an app that offers auto-renewable subscriptions, obtain the app-specific shared secret from the initiator, so that you can update your servers to use the code to verify auto-renewable subscriptions. Once the app transfer is complete, [generate an app-specific shared secret](/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/generate-a-shared-secret-to-verify-receipts) so that users outside of your organization no longer have access to it.

### Apps using TestFlight

TestFlight beta testing should be turned off for all beta versions of the app prior to initiating app transfer. You can do this by removing all builds and testers from the app you want transferred and clearing each information field below Test Information for every localization.

### Apps using Xcode Cloud

All Xcode Cloud related data from the app you want transferred must be removed prior to initiating app transfer. You can [remove all Xcode Cloud data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/removing-your-project-from-xcode-cloud) from Settings under the Xcode Cloud tab in App Store Connect.

### Apps using App Groups

Once an app has completed transfer, the app group can be deleted from the transferor’s [account](https://developer.apple.com/account) and registered to the recipient’s [account](https://developer.apple.com/account). This won't impact the app’s availability on the App Store.

### Apps using keychain sharing

Keychain sharing continues to work only until the app is updated. Therefore, you must rebuild the keychain when submitting updates. If your keychain group is defined in the Xcode project, replace it with a group created by the recipient, incorporating their Team ID for continued keychain sharing. After the update, users must re-login once as the app cannot retrieve the authentication token from the keychain.

### Apps using push notifications

The recipients [APNs certificates](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/establishing-a-certificate-based-connection-to-apns) remain valid until their expiration date. After that, the recipient team must generate a new APNs certificate to continue signing pushes. If you use keys instead of certificates, you can generate new [APNs keys](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/establishing-a-token-based-connection-to-apns) within the recipient team or reuse an existing APNs-enabled key from the recipient team. In both cases, you must update your APNs servers with the chosen key.

### Apps using Apple Pay

If you transfer an app that uses Apple Pay, the merchant ID isn't transferred along with the app. Transactions continue to be successful as long as the original certificates are valid. However, when you submit an update, a new merchant ID must be created on the recipient’s account.

### Apps using Sign in with Apple

As part of preparing your data for the recipient before the transfer, you'll need to [generate a transfer identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapple/transferring-your-apps-and-users-to-another-team) for each user in your database. You can do this through a REST service endpoint provided by Apple.

If you have grouped your apps for Sign in with Apple, you'll need to ungroup them before initiating the transfer.

When you transfer an app configured with "Sign in with Apple," the associated Service ID will also transfer. If you want to avoid transferring the Service ID, you must [remove its association](/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/configure-sign-in-with-apple-for-the-web) before you start the transfer process.

### Apps created with Mac Catalyst

To transfer apps created with [Mac Catalyst](/mac-catalyst/) that don’t [offer universal purchase](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-platforms/), both the iPad app (primary app ID) and the Mac app (Mac Catalyst app ID) need to be transferred.

Initiate the transfer of your iPad app first, and then the associated Mac app. It’s important to transfer the Mac app as well, as the transfer recipient won’t be able to use Mac Catalyst to create a new Mac app based on the iPad app.

### Apps using Wallet

If your app distributes Wallet passes that require updates from your app or web service, you will need to reissue these passes with a new identifier after the transfer. The new identifiers ensure that the passes are signed with certificates from your Apple Developer account. To minimize user confusion and avoid interruption, we recommend providing a message in your app to let users know that their previously issued pass will become inactive and to download a new pass from your app or web service.

[Learn about distributing, updating, and accepting passes.](/wallet/get-started/)

[Learn about best practices for setting alerts.](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/presentation/alerts/)

### Apps using iCloud

If your app uses any of the following, it will be transferred to the transfer recipient after they accept the app transfer.

- iCloud to store user data
- iCloud containers
- KVS identifiers associated with the app

When you transfer an app that shares a CloudKit container with other apps on your account, the transfer will impact those apps. Other apps will lose their ability to read or store data in the transferred CloudKit container. Additionally, the transferor will no longer have access to user data for the transferred app through the iCloud dashboard. Any app updates will disable the app’s ability to read or store data using the transferred CloudKit container.

If your app uses iCloud Key-Value Storage (KVS), the full KVS value will be embedded in any new provisioning profiles you create for the transferred app. Update your entitlements plist with the full KVS value in your provisioning profile.

[Learn about building apps using CloudKit.](/icloud/)

### Apps using Game Center and Apple Arcade

**Multiplayer Compatibility: ** Apps that are part of a cross-app multiplayer compatibility matrix are no longer compatible with or appear in the other app’s matrix. Once the app transfers, the recipient must [add multiplayer compatibility](/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/add-multiplayer-compatibility/) to the app in order for it to work with their existing apps.

**Game Center Groups: **Apps that are part of a Game Center group are removed from the group during the transfer. After the transfer, all leaderboards and achievements revert to their original status. Leaderboards that were originally a group leaderboard retain the `grp.` prefix in their identifier. After the transfer is complete, the recipient can add the app to the [Game Center groups](/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/add-multiplayer-compatibility/).

**Merged Leaderboards: **Leaderboards that were originally single leaderboards but were merged into a group lose the grp.prefix after transfer. They'll revert to their original leaderboard IDs before the merge. After the app transfer, the recipient must update the app build with the new leaderboard IDs so that scores post correctly.

**Matchmaking: **Matchmaking configuration isn’t transferred along with the app. For Game Center matchmaking to work, [matchmaking rules must be created or modified](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/matchmaking_rules) on the recipient’s side after transfer is complete.

### Apps distributed on alternative app marketplaces

Before initiating a transfer, the transferor should notify any impacted alternative app marketplaces about the transfer of the app. Both the transferor and recipient are responsible for notifying marketplaces of any changes.

If you’re transferring an app that’s distributed on an alternative app marketplace, the recipient must have signed [the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU](/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#distribution-eu) and have [the same marketplace added in App Store Connect](/help/app-store-connect/managing-alternative-distribution/manage-distribution-on-an-alternative-app-marketplace) before the transfer for the app to remain available for download. Transferred apps are only available on alternative app marketplaces that were added in App Store Connect by both the transferor and recipient before the transfer.

### Nominations

Nominations can't be transferred. If you wish to share nomination details with the recipient, please document your current nominations and provide them to the recipient directly before initiating the transfer.

[Learn more about nominating your app for featuring.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-featuring-nominations/nominate-your-app-for-featuring)

### App bundles

When you transfer an app that is part of an app bundle, you can no longer view your app bundle’s history. It’s important to make a record of your app bundle information before you transfer the app.

### Accessibility Nutrition Labels

If you [indicate support](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/manage-accessibility-nutrition-labels) for accessibility features for your app or include an accessibility URL, these support details and the URL will transfer to the recipient. After the transfer is complete, the recipient may want to update the accessibility URL to their own website.

### Apps using webhooks

If you have webhooks configured for your app, they will transfer to the recipient. If you don’t want webhook events delivered to your web server after the transfer, [delete the webhooks](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/manage-webhooks#delete-a-webhook) before you transfer the app. Alternatively, the recipient can [update the webhooks](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/manage-webhooks#manage-webhook-details) to their own web server after the transfer is complete.

 accordion end 

## What happens during and after an app transfer

After an app is transferred, its associated App ID is also transferred to the recipient’s developer account. If the transferor’s App ID was a wildcard App ID, it’s converted to an explicit App ID that exactly matches the app’s bundle ID.

The transferor is responsible for exchanging the actual code set and building assets directly with the recipient. Be sure to inform the recipient about any capabilities or App Store configuration added to the app, such as keychain sharing, Game Center, or push notifications, so these are maintained in future updates.

Keep in mind after an app transfer, you can’t generate new or additional promo codes, regardless of the app's ownership status. You can create up to 100 promo codes per app version, and these codes remain valid for four weeks from the date of generation.

## Data for Sales and Trends and Payments and Financial Reports

If you transfer your app, you’ll continue to have access to information for payments and sales that occurred prior to the transfer. However, after the transfer, you won’t have access to information regarding sales and payments that take place afterward. The recipient of the transferred app will only receive payment and sales information for transactions that occurred after the transfer.

## Data for App Analytics

When you transfer an app from your account to someone else, you'll no longer have access to the app's data in App Analytics. However, you can still view historical performance data in the [Sales and Trends](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/trends) section. If someone transfers an app to you, you'll get access to all analytics data as of April 1, 2015, or since the app was first made available on the App Store, whichever occurred later.

Manage asset packs

# Overview of Apple-hosted asset packs

The [Background Assets framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundassets) allows you to schedule background downloads of additional content using your server or content delivery network (CDN). Starting with iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26, if you use Managed Background Assets, the system automatically manages downloads, updates, compression, and more for your assets. Additionally, you can choose to use Apple-Hosted Background Assets for apps distributed through TestFlight and the App Store, and Apple will host the content on your behalf.

Assets for Managed Background Assets are managed through asset packs that you configure using a command-line packaging tool in Xcode. These asset packs can be downloaded by users independent of an app build. When you use Apple hosting, asset packs can also be uploaded to App Store Connect independent of an app build.

Learn how to [download Apple-hosted asset packs in your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundassets/downloading-apple-hosted-asset-packs) and [test them locally](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundassets/testing-asset-packs-locally).

After you upload an asset pack to App Store Connect, you can [test it using TestFlight](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/test-apple-hosted-asset-packs), and [submit it for distribution](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-apple-hosted-asset-packs) on the App Store.

## overview-of-export-compliance

Manage app information

# Overview of export compliance

If your app uses, accesses, contains, implements, or incorporates encryption, and you intend to upload, test, and distribute it, you need to determine your export compliance requirements in App Store Connect.

Examples of apps requiring an export compliance determination include, but aren’t limited to, apps that use:

- Standard encryption algorithms.
- Crypto functionality within Apple’s operating system.
- Proprietary or non-standard encryption algorithms. The US Government defines "non-standard cryptography" as any implementation of “cryptography” involving the incorporation or use of proprietary or unpublished cryptographic functionality, including encryption algorithms or protocols that have not been adopted or approved by a duly recognized international standards body (e.g., IEEE, IETF, ISO, ITU, ETSI, 3GPP, TIA, and GSMA) and haven’t otherwise been published.

Please note that it’s your responsibility to review the [Export Administration Regulation](https://bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/encryption) to determine whether your app's use of encryption requires a formal classification (Commodity Classification Automated Tracking System or CCATS) from BIS. you're responsible for all liabilities associated with misinterpretation of export regulations or claiming exemption inaccurately. To learn about encryption export controls, search for "encryption policy" on the US Department of Commerce  [Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)](https://www.bis.doc.gov/) website. The import and export of encryption apps distributed in France are also controlled by the French Government. The main items of control for France are Secure Storage, Secure Communications, and Security Anti-Virus applications. Exemptions include Banking and Medical applications. For more information about these French controls, visit the [Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (ANSSI)](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/) website.

When you submit a new version of your app, you’ll need to answer questions in App Store Connect about your app's use of encryption. Follow the steps below before submitting your app to App Review to ensure that you’re submitting the right documentation and to bypass these questions if your app doesn’t use encryption.

## Determine your export compliance requirements

App Store Connect provides a simple way for you to [determine your export compliance requirements](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/determine-and-upload-app-encryption-documentation) by presenting you with a set of questions about your app and where you plan to make it available. Based on your answers, complete the following steps:

| Scenario | Next Steps |
| --- | --- |
| No export compliance documentation required | [Update your app’s information property list (Info.plist) file in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/complying_with_encryption_export_regulations) so that you don’t need to answer encryption questions with each app submission. |
| Export compliance documentation required | - Use App Store Connect to [submit your app encryption documentation](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/determine-and-upload-app-encryption-documentation).
- Once the documentation is approved, attach it to your [beta build](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/provide-export-compliance-information-for-beta-builds) or [app version build](/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/choose-a-build-to-submit).
- [Update your app’s information property list (Info.plist) file in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/complying_with_encryption_export_regulations) so that you don’t need to answer encryption questions with each app submission. |

## overview-of-game-center-groups

Configure Game Center

# Overview of Game Center groups

You can add two or more apps to Game Center group to share leaderboards, achievements, challenges, and activities’ data in App Store Connect.

When you add an app with existing Game Center components to a group, you can choose which leaderboards, achievements, challenges, and activities to retain as part of the group. App Store Connect guides you through this process by presenting only compatible assets and options at each step.

You can define leaderboards, achievements, challenges, and activities for a group in two ways:

- Define the Game Center components for an individual app; then, when you move the app to a group, you specify how the app's Game Center components are added to the group Game Center components.
- Add an app to a group that already has leaderboards, achievements, challenges, and activities defined. The app uses the existing group Game Center components. Like apps, groups can organize leaderboards into sets. If a group uses leaderboard sets, apps you add to the group either already use leaderboard sets or can’t have any leaderboards defined.

An app can belong to only one group, but there are no restrictions on the types of apps within a group. For example, you can create a group containing iOS and macOS apps that share the same leaderboards, achievements, challenges, and activities. There’s no limit to the number of groups per account or to the number of apps that can belong to a group.

When you're ready to release a version of your app that belongs to a group, decide which draft group leaderboards, achievements, challenges, and activities will go live with the app. If you add live leaderboards, achievements, challenges, and activities to a group, they'll stay live without submitting an app version. In addition, you set the app’s multiplayer compatibility options to include the other apps in the group. [Learn how to manage an app version for Game Center.](/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/manage-an-app-version-for-game-center)

Configure Game Center

# Overview of Game Center

Game Center is Apple’s social gaming network that lets players track their progress, invite friends to play, start multiplayer games through auto-match, and more. It also boosts the discovery of your games across players’ devices. Once you’ve implemented Game Center features, you’re ready to enter related metadata in App Store Connect.

**Note: **To add a game with Game Center features to a new app bundle, the game must be “Ready for Distribution" on at least one App Store storefront. For games distributed through [alternative distribution](/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu), availability on at least one App Store storefront is required to utilize Game Center functionality.

You can complete the steps below in the order they're listed or move between steps as needed.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, Developer, or Marketing. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

1. **Enable Game Center in Xcode.**

In Xcode, create your project, enter an app name and bundle ID, then enable Game Center, which adds the GameKit framework and Game Center Entitlement to your project. [Learn more about enabling Game Center in Xcode.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/enabling_and_configuring_game_center)
2. **Configure Game Center in App Store Connect.**

In App Store Connect, [add an app to your account](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-a-new-app) that matches the bundle ID in Xcode, [enable your app version for Game Center](/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/manage-an-app-version-for-game-center), and [configure Game Center components](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-game-center-components), such as [leaderboards](/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/manage-leaderboards), [achievements](/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/manage-achievements), [challenges](/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/manage-challenges), [activities](/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/manage-activities), [groups](/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/overview-of-game-center-groups), and [multiplayer compatibility](/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/add-multiplayer-compatibility).
3. **Implement Game Center features.**

To integrate Game Center into your app using Xcode, add the necessary code and configure the service's components. Although these components are set up independently from your app bundle, they must be closely integrated with your game's code to fulfill all design and development requirements. [Learn more.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit)

[Learn the guidance and best practices that can help you design a great experience for Game Center.](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/game-center)
4. **Test your game.**

Ensure that your Game Center components work individually and together. Apple enables all prerelease development to take place in the same server environment as released games, so you can play with the full player base, not just other testers.
5. **Distribute your game.**

Add your Game Center components to your desired platform version before submitting your game for review.

Making payments to Apple

# Overview of making payments to Apple

Depending on your business model and features you implement, you may be responsible for making payments to Apple.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, or Finance. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Update your account for invoicing requirements

Before your first invoice is issued, make sure you’ve [updated your account for invoicing requirements](/help/app-store-connect/making-payments-to-apple/update-your-account-for-invoicing-requirements), otherwise you may be invoiced without the applicable tax treatment applied or in the default currency.

### Report any necessary purchases to Apple

If your app offers alternative payments or is linking out, you’re required to use the External Purchase Server API to report transactions to Apple for calculation and collection purposes. Required reporting includes refunds, corrections, renewals, one-time purchases, and transactions which didn’t result in a purchase. [Learn about implementing the External Purchase Server API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/externalpurchaseserverapi).

### Download your invoice and report

Invoices and reports will be available for download in App Store Connect approximately 15 calendar days after the end of a month where you’ve accrued fees.

The account statement will be available for download on the 28th of each month and contains all outstanding invoices from the current and previous billing periods to assist you in arranging payment.

### Remit payments to Apple

You’ll need to provide payment to Apple within 30 days of the invoice date. You can pay directly from your bank using a unique virtual routing number for your developer account that’s provided on the invoice.

When remitting payments to Apple, please ensure that you use the correct banking details that are quoted on your invoice. To ensure prompt allocation of your payment to your account, please ensure that you quote your invoice number with your payment.

Please allow up to 5 working days for your payment to be allocated to your account.

If you’re sending a remittance advice along with your payment, please ensure that it’s sent to [servicesremittances@apple.com](mailto:servicesremittances@apple.com).

**Note: **If you have multiple invoices, they must all be paid separately. Invoices can’t be combined for a single payment.

### Late payments

Please note that late payments accrue interest and nonpayment may result in the offset of App Store In-App Purchase proceeds owed to you, the app being blocked from distribution, or removal from the Apple Developer Program.

If your invoice is 5 days past due, an email is sent to the Account Holder, Admin, and Finance users letting them know that updates to apps will be blocked if payment is not received within the next 10 days.

If your invoice is 50 days past due, another email will be sent to the Account Holder, Admin, and Finance users letting them know that apps may be removed from the App Store in eligible countries or regions if payment is not received within the next 10 days.

Create product page optimization tests

# Overview of product page optimization

Optimize your iOS or iPadOS app's product page on the App Store by testing up to three different app icons, screenshots, and previews to see which resonate best with customers. Each variant will be randomly shown to a user group you define, and can be localized in any language your app supports. Use App Analytics to evaluate performance and feature the top-performing assets to all users.

The methodology for determining the treatment that’s best at driving app engagement is based on the estimated lift in conversion rate, as well as algorithms that provide confidence in the reliability of the test results. [Learn how to view product page optimization results.](/help/app-store-connect/view-app-analytics/view-product-page-optimization-results)

**Note: **Your app must be in the Ready for Distribution state to test its product page. Releasing a new app version while a test is in progress may impact the results if your version contains assets or metadata that are currently being tested. Product page optimization tests aren't available for custom product pages or for product pages on the App Store for Apple Watch or iMessage.

Treatments are shown to users on the App Store on iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, or later.

Manage your app's availability

# Overview of publishing your app on the App Store

This outlines the general workflow for publishing an app to the App Store.

## Step 1: Choose your build

An app can have several versions, and each version can have multiple builds. To publish your app, [choose which build to submit for review](/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/choose-a-build-to-submit).

## Step 2: Set pricing and availability for the App Store

You must [set a price](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-pricing/set-a-price) and [tax category](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/set-a-tax-category) for your app. By default, your app is available in all [App Store localizations](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-store-localizations), but you can [choose specific regions](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/manage-availability-for-your-app-on-the-app-store) if needed. You also have the option to [publish your app for pre-order](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/publish-for-pre-order).

## Step 3: Submit your app for review

[Submit your app for review](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/overview-of-submitting-for-review) to start the App Review process and make it available on the App Store. Before submission, [complete all required metadata](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/required-localizable-and-editable-properties), and decide whether to [release your app manually, automatically](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/select-an-app-store-version-release-option), or [in phases](/help/app-store-connect/update-your-app/release-a-version-update-in-phases).

## Step 4: View your app status and resolve review issues

Once you submit your app, its status changes to Waiting for Review. If any issues are found, [read and reply to App Review communications](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/reply-to-app-review-messages). After your app is approved, it can take up to 24 hours to go live on the App Store.

## Step 5: Request promo codes for the App Store

After your app is approved, you can [request promo codes](/help/app-store-connect/offer-promo-codes/request-and-manage-promo-codes) to distribute to users before you make your app available on the App Store. Distribute these codes through email or other methods. Users can redeem them when purchasing the app on the App Store.

## overview-of-receiving-payments

Getting paid

# Overview of receiving payments

In order to receive payment from Apple for proceeds for your app or In-App Purchase, you must meet the following requirements:

- Have a Paid Apps Agreement in effect. [Learn more.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-agreements/sign-and-update-agreements)
- Provide banking information in App Store Connect. Payments are sent to the primary bank account on file at the time a payment is processed. Payments to multiple or split bank accounts aren't supported. [Learn more.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-banking-information/enter-banking-information)
- Exceed the minimum monthly [payment threshold](/help/app-store-connect/reference/reporting/minimum-payment-threshold) for each country or region in which you sell content.
- Complete any monthly invoicing requirements you’re subject to based on your country or region. [Learn more.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-tax-information/manage-invoices-and-other-tax-documents)

If you meet those requirements, payments are made to the bank account and the [currency you provided](/help/app-store-connect/manage-banking-information/enter-banking-information) within 45 days of the last day of the fiscal month in which the transaction was completed.

Payments are processed through direct deposit or electronic funds transfer (EFT). When available, payments are issued as low-value transfers rather than high-value wire transfers. Apple's bank consolidates proceeds for each currency in which you have App Store sales, resulting in a single payment to your bank per fiscal month. Payments may be subject to bank fees and transaction costs charged by your bank or intermediate financial institutions, reducing the amount that's deposited in your bank account.

Access the Payments and Financial Reports section in App Store Connect to view your outstanding [payments](/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/view-payments-and-proceeds) , amounts paid, applied exchange rates, and more. You can also [download financial reports](/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/download-financial-reports), which are made available for the previous fiscal month’s earnings by the first Friday of the current fiscal month.

Financial reports show payments made to you based on closed transactions and finalized proceeds using the [Apple fiscal calendar](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wa/jumpTo?page=fiscalcalendar). Reports only include paid transactions where we are able to collect payment from the customer (view Schedule 2 of your Apple Developer Agreement).

### Additional information

If you have a Nepal-based bank account, your payments from Apple will be subject to a 5% advance income tax  (rate may be subject to change under the local tax regulations), deducted from your payment by the local correspondent bank and settled with the local tax authority in Nepal. Apple isn't responsible for deducting or remitting this tax to the local tax authority.

### FAQs

### What is the exchange rate applied to my payments?

Our bank converts payment amounts into the currency of your bank account. The exchange rate is established by our bank and, due to Apple's volume, is generally a more favorable rate than used by your local bank. The rates are typically the spot rate on the date of payment and no more than three business days prior to the date the proceeds are received into your account.

### Why am I not receiving financial report notifications?

If financial reports are available for your account and you have not been receiving the related email notifications, confirm that your user profile is set up to [receive financial report notifications](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/view-and-edit-your-profile). If these items are set up correctly, check your email client and/or spam filter to make sure the email address do-not-reply@apple.com isn't being blocked.

## overview-of-reporting-tools

Measure app performance

# Overview of reporting tools

App Store Connect provides the following reporting tools to help you measure the performance of your apps and In-App Purchases on the App Store.

## App Analytics

App Analytics lets you measure user engagement, marketing campaigns, and monetization for your apps and In-App Purchases distributed on the App Store. You can use App Analytics to:

- Find out which sources drive the most traffic to your app’s product page.
- Calculate conversion rate (the number of people who view your app’s product page to total downloads and pre-orders of your app).
- Find out which countries or regions have the most engaged users by sessions and proceeds per paying user.
- Compare your app’s performance to the performance of similar apps so you can put your performance into context.
- Find out which App Clips are successful at driving first-time app downloads.
- View how many users have pre-ordered your app.
- Compare the performance of different product page treatments.
- Download data for your apps in bulk, including data about App Store engagement, app usage, and commerce.

App Analytics provides app developers with usage data collected from users who have agreed in to share their diagnostics on devices running iOS 8 and later, macOS 11 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and visionOS 1 and later. To protect user privacy, App Analytics only shows data after a certain number of data points are available. App Analytics doesn’t include data from watchOS.

## Sales and Trends

[Sales and Trends](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/trends)  provides next-day data on App Store sales and app units, enabling you to assess the performance of your free or paid apps across iOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS, including any In-App Purchases. Data in Sales and Trends is recorded when a customer initiates a transaction on the App Store. Sales data for iMessage apps and sticker packs is included in the data for the containing iOS app.

- View top apps or In-App Purchases and their contribution to your overall business.
- If you offer auto-renewable subscriptions, view subscriptions data on the summary, retention, state, and event pages to gain quick insight into the performance of your subscription business.
- View units, proceeds, sales and pre-orders with options to filter data by selected time period, app, subscription, and country or region.
- Download and view reports in order to further analyze the performance of your app or subscriptions.

**Note: **After transferring your app, you’ll retain access to sales data for transactions that occurred before the transfer. However, you won’t be able to view sales data for transactions that occur after the transfer is complete.

## Payments and Financial Reports

Payments and Financial Reports provides information on final payments made to you, based on settled transactions and finalized proceeds, according to the Apple [fiscal calendar](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wa/jumpTo?page=fiscalcalendar). Financial reports include only paid transactions from the App Store, where payment has been collected from the customer. (For more details, review the Paid Apps Agreement.) You can opt in to receive email alerts notifying you when financial reports are available for download in App Store Connect.

[Learn about receiving payments from Apple.](/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/overview-of-receiving-payments)

## Automating reports

You can automate downloads of your Sales and Trends, App Analytics, and Financial Reports with the [App Store Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi).

## overview-of-submitting-for-review

Manage submissions to App Review

# Overview of submitting for review

The review process covers every version of your app and its content, like In-App Purchases and Apple-hosted asset packs, to ensure a safe and trustworthy experience for users and to support developers' success.

Our goal is to make the submission process as convenient and efficient as possible. While you typically submit one submission for review at a time per platform, you also have the flexibility to submit items with one additional submission, even if you already have an app version submitted for review.

For example, if you have an app version currently under review, you can also submit an In-App Event in a separate submission, or if you have a custom product page under review, you can also submit an app version in a separate submission.

**Note: **Submissions may not be reviewed in the order you submit them.

You can choose to submit items for review together with, or separately from, an app version. If your submission includes an app version, items will be reviewed together with that app version. If your submission doesn’t include an app version, or your submission includes items associated with multiple platforms, items will be reviewed together with the latest version of the platform you specify during the submission process. Use the [App Review information](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/platform-version-information#app-review-information) section on the latest approved app version for that platform to provide additional information or context that will help App Review during the review process.

App versions for each platform are submitted separately. The status of any app versions on one platform doesn’t influence the status of app versions on other platforms.

Manage your submissions and messages with the App Review team in the App Review section of the sidebar. This section may display four types of content:

- App (iOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS) Submission: App versions and/or items that you submitted to App Review, and any related messages from App Review.
- Beta Build: Beta versions of your app that you submitted and App Review didn’t accept, and any related messages from App Review.
- Beta Asset Pack: Beta versions of asset packs that you submitted and App Review didn’t accept, and any related messages from App Review.
- App Review Message: Other messages from App Review that don’t relate to a submission.

[Learn about upcoming submission requirements.](/news/upcoming-requirements/)

[Learn how to submit using the App Store Connect API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/app-store-version-submissions)

### FAQs

### How many submissions can I submit for review at a time?

- Each platform can have one app version submission under review at a time.
- A platform can have a maximum of two submissions under review at a time: one that includes an app version and one that includes items, like In-App Events or custom product pages, without an app version.

### What items can I add to a submission?

Items associated with different platforms can't be added to the same submission. For example, if you’ve selected the macOS platform for a submission with an Apple-hosted asset pack, you’ll need to create a separate submission to submit a custom product page for iOS.

In addition to an app version, you can add the following items to a submission to App Review:

- [In-App Events](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-an-in-app-event)
- [Custom product pages](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-a-custom-product-page)
- [Product page optimization tests](/help/app-store-connect/create-product-page-optimization-tests/run-a-test)
- [Apple-hosted asset packs](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-apple-hosted-asset-packs)
- [Game Center components](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-game-center-components), including new or modified leaderboards, leaderboard sets, achievements, challenges, and activities

**Note: **In-App Purchases and subscriptions aren’t eligible to be included as items in a submission since they have a separate submission process.

## overview-of-testing-game-center

Configure Game Center

# Overview of testing Game Center

Apple allows all prerelease development and testing to occur in exactly the same server environment as released games. This allows you to test how your app interacts with Game Center and brings several advantages including:

- Simplifying the testing of version updates by allowing testers to play with the full player base, not just other testers
- Removing implementation differences between the sandbox and production environments

By design, the achievements and high scores of a particular Game Center user are visible to that user's friends. This includes leaderboard scores, achievements, challenges, and activities that haven't been formally released as part of a particular game version. Similarly, any game a Game Center player has played is visible to all of that player’s friends, even if that game has not yet been released.

If this data needs to be kept private as part of your release strategy, consider creating separate accounts for prerelease testing and carefully manage which Game Center users are allowed to become friends with those accounts.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, Developer, or Marketing. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

Testing a Game Center-enabled app involves the following steps:

1. [Enable an app version for Game Center.](/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/manage-an-app-version-for-game-center#enable-app-version-for-game-center)
2. Add leaderboards, achievements, challenges, or activities to the app version that you’d like to test.

## overview-of-testing-in-sandbox

Test In-App Purchases

# Overview of testing in sandbox

Apple provides a sandbox environment that lets you test In-App Purchases and Apple Pay transactions using test accounts without incurring charges. This environment uses the infrastructure of the App Store and returns transactions as if payments were successfully processed instead of processing actual payments.

You can test the following scenarios:

| Scenario | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Testing App Store country or region | Test on different storefronts using the same Sandbox account, without having to create new testers. Associate your sandbox testers with any of the 175 App Store storefronts. |
| Testing auto-renewable subscription events | Test [auto-renewable subscription events](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/testing_in-app_purchases_with_sandbox/testing_an_auto-renewable_subscription), such as renewals, state changes, interrupted purchases, winback offers, and contingent pricing without having to wait the length of the subscription duration. |
| Testing App Store Server Notifications | Test that your server receives [App Store Server Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/testing_in-app_purchases_with_sandbox/testing_app_store_server_notifications) and [notifications for the sandbox environment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreservernotifications). |
| Testing Family Sharing | Create Sandbox Test Families to test [Family Sharing](/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/turn-on-family-sharing-for-in-app-purchases) in your app and share access to auto-renewable subscriptions and non-consumables with up to five test family members. |
| Testing Apple Pay transactions | Test your app's implementation of Apple Pay with test credit and debit cards. [Learn more.](/apple-pay/sandbox-testing/) |

To get started, [Create Sandbox Apple Accounts](/help/app-store-connect/test-in-app-purchases/create-a-sandbox-apple-account) in App Store Connect and use them to sign in to devices that are running a development-signed version of your app. You’ll need to [enable Developer Mode on each device](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device) so you can use it to test your app.

Alternatively, you can test In-App Purchases with [StoreKit Testing in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode/), a local test environment that doesn’t require a connection to App Store servers to test In-App Purchases. Use StoreKit Testing in Xcode to test In-App Purchases before you configure them in App Store Connect or to test your code when a network connection isn’t available.

# Payment information

Payment information will display in the corresponding currency of each region where sales occur.

| Field title | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Region | This is where the unit sale took place. Hold the pointer over a region name to reveal all App Store countries or regions included in that region. |
| Units Sold | This is the total number of units sold in the corresponding region. Note that this value only includes purchases. |
| Balance* | This consists of any amounts not paid out from previous months, or amounts returned. |
| Earned | This displays the gross earnings amount per region for that fiscal period. |
| Total* | This displays the total earnings per region, including both the previous months and the current month's balances. |
| Taxes and Adjustments | This displays the net of all input taxes, adjustments, or withholding taxes for that region. Hold the pointer over the amount to view a breakdown of all taxes and adjustments included in the net total presented.

- **Withholding Tax.** Withholding tax represents amounts withheld by Apple and remitted to taxing authorities in accordance with government requirements specific to the country or region. Withholding taxes can vary based on your location, the completion of any optional tax forms and the tax treaties entered into by your country or region. Visit [Provide tax information](/help/app-store-connect/manage-tax-information/provide-tax-information) for more information.
- **Input Taxes.** Input taxes are amounts added to your payment to meet your tax requirements in certain countries or regions. For example, Goods and Services Tax (GST) applies if you're based in Australia on the basis you're registered for GST. |
| Total Owed | This is the sum of Earned and Taxes and Adjustments and displays the estimated amount owed to you in the currency of each reported region and revenue type. If there is a carry forward balance, this is the sum of Total, and Taxes and Adjustments. |
| Exchange Rate | This is the exchange rate at the time of payment, used to calculate total proceeds in your bank account currency. The exchange rate is only displayed if the payment for the report month selected has been disbursed.

Per Schedule 2 to your Developer Agreement, our bank converts payment amounts into the currency of your bank account. The exchange rate is established by our bank and, due to Apple’s volume, is generally a more favorable rate than used by your local bank. The rates are typically the spot rate on the date of payment and no more than three business days prior to the date the proceeds are received into your account. |
| Proceeds or Total Estimated Proceeds | The name of this column will vary depending on whether or not a payment has been executed for the report month selected.

- **Total Estimated Proceeds.** This is displayed if payment to you has not yet been made. This is the estimated amount of proceeds that will be dispersed in your bank account currency.

If iTunes doesn't have an exchange rate for a particular currency, the amount is converted to USD by default. This is for display purposes only, and payment will be made in your chosen bank account currency.
- **Proceeds.** This is displayed if payment has been transferred to your bank account. This is the actual amount of proceeds paid for the corresponding region and report period. Values are displayed in your bank account currency. |
| Payment Date | The payment date displayed in Payments and Financial Reports is the date the payment leaves Apple’s bank. |

* Balance and Total columns will only be displayed if there is a running balance from the previous payment period.

## performance-metrics

Reference

# Performance metrics

## Rates and ratios

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Retention rate | Retention measures the usage of your app over time starting from the first installation or re-download on the App Store.

Daily Retention = Active Devices on day X of the retention period/Active Devices during the entire retention period.

For example, if your app was first downloaded by customers on 100 devices on May 1, and seven days later (on May 8) 20 devices are still active with at least one session, the retention rate on May 8 is 20% (or 20 active devices out of 100). |
| Conversion rate | Calculated by dividing the number of downloads and pre-orders on the App Store by unique device impressions. When a user pre-orders an app, it counts toward your conversion rate. It's not counted again when it downloads to their device.

For example, if your app is viewed on the App Store on 100 devices, and 50 users download it, and 20 users pre-order it, your conversion rate for the selected period would be 70%. |
| Product page conversion rate | The number of downloads and pre-orders that came from your app’s App Store product page divided by unique product page views. When a user pre-orders an app, it counts toward your conversion rate. It's not counted again when it downloads to their device. number of First-Time Downloads, Redownloads, and Pre-Orders that came from your app’s product page by Unique Product Page Views. Pre-Orders are counted on the day the pre-order is initiated and, to avoid double counting, the subsequent download is excluded.

For example, if your product page is viewed on 100 devices, and 50 users download the app, and 20 users pre-order it, your conversion rate for the selected period would be 70%. |
| Sales per paying user | Your app’s total sales (including associated In-App Purchases) / your app’s total number of paying users on the App Store for the selected period.

For example, if your app’s total sales for the period is $100, and your app has 100 paying users, your sales per paying user is $1. |
| Sessions per active device | The number of times your app was opened by an App Store customer for at least two seconds / the number of active devices for your app in the selected period.

For example, if your app was opened 100 times, and you have 10 active devices for the same period, then your Sessions Per Active Device ratio is 10. |
| Proceeds per paying user | The estimated amount you'll receive for sales of your apps or In-App Purchases / your app’s total number of paying users on the App Store for the selected period.

For example, if your app’s total proceeds for the period are $100, and your app has 100 paying users, your proceeds per paying user are $1. |
| Crash rate | A metric available for [peer group benchmarks](/help/app-store-connect/view-app-analytics/view-peer-group-benchmarks) that shows the number of crashes per session for the selected period.

For example, if your app had 10 crashes and 100 sessions for the selected period, the crash rate is 10%. |

# Product page optimization metrics

Product page optimization metrics terms and definitions

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Product page | A page on the App Store that informs people about your app and lets them download it onto their device. |
| Test | An experiment in which different treatments of your product page are shown to a percentage of users so their performance can be compared to the performance of your original product page during the same timeframe. |
| Variant | An instance of your product page (either the original or a treatment). |
| Treatment | A variant of your product page that’s compared to your original product page. |
| Original | Your default product page, which serves as the control for your test. |
| Referral traffic | Visits to any variant of your product page from a direct URL. |
| Apply treatment | The action of replacing the metadata on your original product page with the metadata from one of your treatments. |
| Confidence level | The probability that the data gathered in a test suggests that two variants are performing differently. |
| Baseline | The variant that the other pages are being compared against. |
| Collecting data | Data is still being collected to determine whether this variant is performing better than the baseline. |
| Performing better | This variant is performing better than the baseline with at least 90% confidence. |
| Performing worse | This variant is performing worse than the baseline with at least 90% confidence. |
| Likely to be inconclusive | Based on the current results, there likely won’t be enough data after 90 days to determine how this variant is performing compared to the baseline. |
| Estimated conversion rate | The estimated percentage of people that downloaded or pre-ordered your app from a certain product page variant. This estimate incorporates the data observed during the test, as well as existing data. |
| Estimated relative lift | The estimated relative increase in conversion rate for a variant as compared to the selected baseline. It requires fewer weeks of data to determine significance on higher improvement values (e.g. 30%) as opposed to lower improvement values (e.g. 5%). Your actual test duration will depend on the level of improvement detected during your specific test. |
| Bayesian reasoning | A statistical method where probability expresses a degree of confidence in an event; used to justify confidence in your conversion rate lift. |
| Credible interval | The probable range of your lift or conversion rate. This represents a 90% interval, meaning there’s a 90% probability that the conversion rate or lift falls within this range. |

# Promote In-App Purchases

iOS

Promoted In-App Purchases appear on your product page, can display in search results, and may be featured on the Today, Games, and Apps tabs.

You can promote up to 20 In-App Purchases on their App Store product page simultaneously, in all countries or regions, for devices running iOS 11 or later. This gives you the flexibility to change the In-App Purchases that appear on your product page at any time based on your business needs — for example, such as launching a limited-time price promotion or offering exclusive content. Promoting In-App Purchases can also encourage downloads of your app. When a user doesn’t have your app installed but wants to buy a promoted In-App Purchases, they’ll receive a prompt to download the app first. Once the app is downloaded, the transaction will continue in the app.

Your app must support the PurchaseIntent API in order for the App Store to display your promoted product pages. All In-App Purchases and metadata must be approved by App Review.

## provide-app-motion-information

Reference

# Provide app motion information

App motion is a required app information property for all visionOS apps on the App Store. This information displays on your app’s product page on the App Store to inform users who may be sensitive to apps with high motion.

There are two possible values for this property:

| Value | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Yes, this app contains high motion | Has frequent fast or sudden camera movements, quick turns, or unusual orientations. |
| No, this app doesn't contain high motion | Doesn't have frequent fast or sudden camera movements, quick turns, or unusual orientations. |

## About app motion

On Apple Vision Pro, the user’s viewpoint acts as a virtual camera and moves with the motion of their head and body. In some experiences, the virtual camera moves without the user moving their head or body (either controlled by the user through hand gestures or input devices, or scripted by the app without user input).

#### When to choose “No, this app doesn’t contain high motion”

If the virtual camera in your app doesn’t move without the user moving their head or body, choose “No, this app doesn’t contain high motion.” You won't need to assess your app further.

#### When to assess your app for high motion

If the virtual camera in your app moves without the user moving their head or body, you might need to choose “Yes, this app contains high motion.” To find out, follow the guidance below to assess your app experience for:

- Fast forward or backward motion
- Unusual orientations
- Fast rotation speeds
- Unexpected motion

Keep the following in mind:

- Assess only the motion of the user’s viewpoint as a virtual camera, not the motion of a user-controlled character or vehicle. This distinction is especially important when the motion of the virtual camera is different than the motion of a controlled character or vehicle.
- If your app has multiple configuration options that affect the motion experience, use the default configuration to assess the experience.
- Rate the average motion in your app. If there’s only a brief moment of high motion at a few points in your app and the rest contains no motion, you don’t need to indicate high motion in your app.
- If your app consists of several different first-party experiences that are intended by design to be part of the core app experience, consider the average motion across all of them and whether the average contains high motion.
- Apps that host a variety of third-party content (like user-uploaded videos or HTML5 games) shouldn’t have a high motion label, unless the app’s intent is to have lots of content with high motion (like user uploads of their first-person thrill-seeking experiences).

#### Elements to assess

### Fast forward or backward motion

Combinations of forward or backward virtual camera motion can lead to very high pixel speeds.

Example 1 demonstrates the pixel speed when the camera moves forward quickly, with objects close by, resulting in high motion. The red arrows indicate the objects’ pixel speed in the scene.

Example 2 shows a much slower pixel speed that doesn’t fall under the category of high motion. This can be produced by moving objects farther away or with slower camera motion.

Choose “Yes, this app contains high motion” if the combination of forward or backward virtual camera speed and object distance in your app produces a pixel speed similar to or higher than that shown in Example 1.

**Example 1:** High pixel speed

 /////////// 

![](/assets/elements/icons/symbols/play-circle.svg)

 /////////// 
 /////////// 
**Example 2:** Low pixel speed

![](/assets/elements/icons/symbols/play-circle.svg)

 /////////// 

### Unusual orientations

When the horizon of the virtual world doesn't match the real world, users may experience discomfort. The virtual camera rolls left or right around its longitudinal axis or pitches up or down in situations like these.

Choose “Yes, this app contains high motion” if the virtual camera rolls around its longitudinal axis or pitches up or down more than 10 degrees, with less than 5 minutes between each instance. This includes loops, steep banks or slopes, and upside-down motion.

### Fast rotation speeds

Users can also experience discomfort when they experience fast camera rotation speeds around their vertical axis (yaw).

Choose “Yes, this app contains high motion” if the virtual camera yaws left or right smoothly, while simultaneously moving forward or backward at speeds equal to or slower than running. This includes user-controlled and scripted smooth camera turns in first-person-view experiences.

### Unexpected motion

Choose “Yes, this app contains high motion” if the virtual camera makes unexpected and/or unpredictable motions with less than 5 minutes between each instance. This includes falls, turns, spins, and other orientation changes.

If your region is denied under the Brazilian legislation, no reduced rate of withholding is available. Contact your tax authority if you have questions regarding how to obtain a tax residency certificate.

Your withholding tax rate won’t be reduced until your tax residency certificate is received and reviewed for applicable treaty benefits between Brazil and your country or region of residence. You can start selling content in Brazil (assuming you’ve submitted all required banking and tax information), but payments will be subject to the applicable withholding tax at the standard rate until your residency certificate is reviewed and tax rate benefits are confirmed.

If you're a Singapore GST-registered developer, Apple’s commission earned in Korea (region code: KR) and South Asia and Pacific (region code: AP) in relation to your sales on apps and In-App Purchases on the App Store will be considered taxable.

## publish-for-pre-order

Manage your app's availability

# Publish for pre-order

Before releasing your app on the App Store in a new country or region, you can choose to make it available for pre-order. This allows customers to view your product page and order the app before it's released for download.

### Eligibility

You can offer your app for pre-order in any country or region on the App Store where the app hasn't yet been released. Both free and paid apps across all Apple platforms are eligible for pre-orders. In-App Purchases aren’t eligible for pre-order, but you can [set up your In-App Purchases](/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/overview-for-configuring-in-app-purchases), including promotional metadata, in App Store Connect before and during the pre-order period so that everything is ready once your app is released for download. [Promoted In-App Purchases](/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/promote-in-app-purchases) don’t display on your App Store product page until your app is released for download.

App bundles aren’t eligible for pre-order. An app offered for pre-order must have at least one country or region where it’s already Ready for Sale to be included in a new app bundle.

### Customer experience

Customers can start pre-orders on devices running iOS 11.2, iPadOS 13, macOS 10.13.2, tvOS 11.2, and watchOS 6, or later. Users with earlier operating systems can access product pages through direct links but will find the Buy button disabled, prompting them to update their OS to proceed with pre-orders.

Customers can cancel their pre-orders in their App Store settings on iOS and macOS, and on a Windows PC. [Learn more.](https://support.apple.com/HT202723)
If your pre-order’s release date is less than 180 days from the current date, the full release date appears on your app’s product page (for example, “Expected Jan 1, 2024”). For release dates more than 180 days away, only the month and year are displayed (for example, “Expected Jan 2024”).

Customers who pre-order a paid app won't be charged until the app's official download release date. You may adjust the app's price during the pre-order phase; however, any price changes will result in customers being charged the lower amount—either the pre-order price they accepted or the price on the release date. Adjustments are subject to the original accepted terms.

Once your app is released, customers receive a notification, and the app automatically downloads to the device used for pre-ordering. It’ll also download on their eligible devices if they [turn on automatic downloads](https://support.apple.com/HT202180).

[Learn how to manage pre-orders using the App Store Connect API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/app_store/app_pre-orders)

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, or App Manager. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Publish your app for the first time as a pre-order

If this is your first time publishing an app in any country or region on the App Store, follow these steps to make your app available for pre-order. 

**Note: **Once your app is released for download or purchase on the App Store in a country or region, it can no longer be made available for pre-order in that same location.

Monitor ratings and reviews

# Ratings and reviews overview

## Ratings and reviews on the App Store

Users can rate your app on a scale from 1 to 5 stars on all platforms. Additionally, users can submit written reviews for your iOS, macOS, and visionOS apps. However, they can’t do this for tvOS apps. When a customer edits their rating or review, the most recent change will display on your App Store product page. If a user submits a new rating or review, it'll replace the previous submission.

Your App Store product page displays a single overview rating for your app for each country or region of the App Store as well as individual customer ratings and reviews. If enough reviews are available, the device will display a summary of these reviews on iOS 18.1 or later.

Your App Store product page will display a reviews summary on devices with iOS 18.4 or later, generated using large language models (LLMs). This summary presents key highlights from user reviews in a concise paragraph.

**Note: **You can tap and hold the summary to report a concern on the App Store or [report a concern](/help/app-store-connect/monitor-ratings-and-reviews/view-ratings-and-reviews#report-a-concern) in App Store Connect.

iOS apps that use the [WatchKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit) or [Messages](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/messages) frameworks share the same rating across the App Store for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and iMessage.

## View ratings and reviews

You can view all customer ratings and reviews from the App Store directly in App Store Connect. App Store provides an [overview rating](/help/app-store-connect/monitor-ratings-and-reviews/view-ratings-and-reviews) and review summaries for devices running iOS 18.1 or later, specific to selected countries or regions. The country or region associated with a rating reflects the location where the customer initially purchased the app. Additionally, you can view individual app reviews on the App Store.

## Respond to reviews

For iOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS apps on the App Store, you can [respond to customer reviews](/help/app-store-connect/monitor-ratings-and-reviews/respond-to-reviews). When you respond to a customer review, the customer is notified and can update their review in response. If you make multiple edits to your response in a short time, such as to correct a typo, the user receives only one notification. If the customer updates their review on the App Store, users with Admin or Customer Support roles in App Store Connect will be notified, provided they have access and relevant [notifications turned on](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/view-and-edit-your-profile#set-email-notifications).

Your response remains publicly visible on your App Store product page, even if the customer edits their review. You can [edit or delete your response](/help/app-store-connect/monitor-ratings-and-reviews/respond-to-reviews) at any time. Only one response per review will be displayed on the product page.

All ratings, reviews, and responses are publicly available on your App Store product page. Ensure your responses are appropriate for a public audience. If you find a review offensive or inappropriate, [report a concern](/help/app-store-connect/monitor-ratings-and-reviews/view-ratings-and-reviews#report-a-concern).

## Reset app rating

You can [reset your app’s rating](/help/app-store-connect/monitor-ratings-and-reviews/reset-an-app-overview-rating) when you release a new version on the App Store. A message will appear on your product page indicating that the overview rating was recently reset. This message remains until sufficient users have rated the new version, at which point a new overview rating will be displayed.

## reduced-motion-evaluation-criteria

Manage app accessibility

# Reduced Motion evaluation criteria

iOS
macOS
tvOS
visionOS
watchOS

### Description

Motion can enrich app experience, but certain types of motion, such as scaling, spinning, or peripheral motion, cause dizziness or nausea for people with motion sensitivity. Although motion sickness is commonly discussed in the context of augmented and virtual reality, motion can cause reactions in 2D screens as well for users with severe motion-sensitivity conditions. If your app includes these motion triggers, make them optional or provide alternative animations.

### Goals

Everyone should be able to use your app, regardless of whether they have a disability.

The goal of Reduced Motion is to support users with extreme motion sensitivity, who may experience negative side effects, such as nausea, dizziness, headaches, or distraction when encountering certain types of motion triggers. Often, the problematic types of motion are spinning or scaling, and other techniques used to simulate three-dimensional effects or depth.

Well designed animations can convey information intuitively, increasing the usability and understandability of your app. Removing such animations unnecessarily might make your app experience more confusing, so don’t remove or modify all animations prematurely. Review the support criteria below to determine which animations to leave as they are, which animations to modify, and which animations to consider removing entirely.

The following sections provide more detail about how to determine whether your app supports Reduced Motion well. The goal is to help ensure users with disabilities can leverage all common tasks of the app, therefore performing this evaluation will help you determine whether to indicate your app supports Reduced Motion on the App Store.

### Getting started with testing

While you’re not required to use Apple frameworks to indicate support for Reduced Motion, we recommend reviewing how Apple’s system apps respond to the systemwide setting to understand what a good experience is like for users. If you offer your own in-app setting, it should either support similar functionality to the systemwide setting, or offer more granular user interface customization.

Review the resources below for details about enabling the *Reduce Motion* system setting on each device your app supports.

- For iPhone, watch [“How to reduce screen motion on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ddva5UUX2U) and visit [Customize onscreen motion on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph0b691d3ed).
- For iPad, watch [“How to reduce screen motion on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ddva5UUX2U) and visit [Customize onscreen motion on iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipadc509a80c).
- For Mac, visit [Customize onscreen motion on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchlc03f57a1).
- For Apple TV, visit the [Reduce screen motion on Apple TV 4K](https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/atvb1f949820).
- For Apple Vision Pro, visit [Stop or reduce visual motion effects or screen movements on Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/tanfba13872a).
- For Apple Watch, visit the [Adjust text size and other visual settings on Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/apd766b7bd85).

If you don’t have an existing proficiency in testing reduced motion, take some time to go beyond the basics and review the additional resources below.

- Human Interface Guideline > [Motion](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/motion)
- Human Interface Guideline > [Accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility#Motion)

## Indicating support for Reduce Motion

You’re not required to adopt Apple frameworks to indicate support for Reduced Motion, but we recommend detecting when a user has the Apple system setting enabled so they don’t have to manually update another setting for the app to function as expected. If you offer your own in-app setting that has additional customization or granular controls, you may not need to use the Apple system setting.

When testing your app, determine if any views or transitional animations include potential motion triggers that can cause discomfort or distraction for some users. If your app doesn’t contain any problematic motion triggers, you may indicate that it supports Reduced Motion.

- If your app uses depth simulation (including parallax effects, animated blur, and depth-of-field effects), you should disable or change the animation when the user’s setting indicates a need or preference for reduced motion.
- If your app includes multi-axis motion, multi-speed motion, spinning, or vortex effects, you should disable or change the animation when the user’s setting indicates a need or preference for reduced motion.
- If your app includes auto-advancing carousel screens or any other ongoing motion, consider stopping the motion based on the user’s setting, or providing a control to allow the user to stop the motion.
- If third-party or user-generated content is required in your common tasks, refer to the detailed guidance for third-party content on the [Overview of Accessibility Nutrition Labels](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels#tips).
- Review the related links below for more examples of motion triggers.

If your app does contain these types of motion, consider each animation individually.

- Is the animation included purely for stylistic or decorative effect? If so, consider stopping it entirely when the user’s system setting indicates a need or preference for reduced motion.
- Removing animations entirely can have a negative effect on usability and understandability. If the motion itself conveys some meaning, such as a status change (for example, item moved to cart) or a hierarchical context transition (for example, this view is a subview of the prior view), don’t remove the animation entirely. Instead, consider providing a new animation that avoids motion, or at least reduces full screen motion, such as a dissolve, highlight fade, or color shift. Also consider whether you want to replace your default animation, or only use the new one when the user’s setting indicates a need or preference for reduced motion.

Once your app no longer displays problematic motion triggers to users whose setting indicates a need or preference for reduced motion, you may indicate that it supports Reduced Motion.

Even after you’re able to indicate support for Reduced Motion in the common tasks of your app, there are likely further improvements you’ll be able to make to the accessibility of your app. Re-evaluate your app’s support for Reduced Motion every time you update your app. Set a goal to make your app more accessible to more people in every release.

# Remove an app

To remove an app from your main view in Apps, you must first [remove it from the App Store](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/manage-availability-for-your-app-on-the-app-store) for all countries and regions, even if the app was never released. Also, [remove any associated In-App Purchases from sale](/help/app-store-connect/manage-in-app-purchases/set-availability-for-in-app-purchases). For alternative app distribution, you must also [remove the app from marketplace distribution](/help/app-store-connect/managing-alternative-distribution/manage-distribution-on-an-alternative-app-marketplace). To do this, deselect the app from each marketplace in the Integrations tab under Users and Access.

You can’t remove apps that are in the following states: Ready for Review, Waiting for Review, In Review, Metadata Rejected, or Rejected. Apps that are actively being transferred to another account or are part of an app bundle also can’t be removed. If the app is part of an app bundle and hasn’t been approved yet, you must remove it from the bundle before it can be removed from your main view in Apps. App bundles can’t be removed.

**WARNING: **If you remove an app, you’ll lose ownership of the app name. Removed apps can only be restored if the name isn’t currently in use by another developer account. In addition, the SKU can’t be reused in the same organization and if you’ve uploaded a build, your bundle ID can’t be reused.

## reporting-tokens-and-transactions-to-apple

Making payments to Apple

# Reporting tokens and transactions to Apple

In certain regions, if your apps or digital goods and services are offered outside of the App Store, your app or website receives a token when a customer initiates an external purchase. You’ll need to send a monthly report to Apple that includes all transactions associated with these tokens for applicable commission and fee calculation and collection purposes.

### When is it required

Any time you use alternative payment options in your App Store app or sell digital goods and services in your alternatively distributed app, you must submit a monthly report within 15 days after the end of the calendar month. Learn more about using the [External Purchase Server API](/documentation/ExternalPurchaseServerAPI) and [MarketplaceKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/marketplacekit). 

### Sending reports to Apple via External Purchase Server API

To send a report to Apple, call the External Purchase Server API from your server. For details on how use the API, visit [External Purchase Server API](/documentation/ExternalPurchaseServerAPI) and [Reporting transactions for the Core Technology Commission](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/marketplacekit/reporting-transactions-for-core-technology-commission).

### What needs to be included

Your report must include all tokens, regardless of whether they resulted in a completed transaction. This includes refunds, corrections, renewals, one-time purchases, and transactions that didn’t lead to a purchase.

### Regional requirements

Reporting tokens and transactions to Apple applies to apps distributed in the European Union and Japan that use external distribution APIs. Developers that offer alternative payment options in their app on the App Store in Japan are required to report transactions manually. For details, visit [Payment options on the App Store in Japan](/support/payment-options-on-the-app-store-in-japan/).

## request-and-manage-promo-codes

Offer promo codes

# Request and manage promo codes

**Note: **Starting March 2026, promo codes for In-App Purchases will no longer be available. Please plan to transition to Offer Codes, a more powerful way to run promotions, provide discounts, and engage with your customers. Offer Codes allow you to set customer eligibility, expiration dates, and generate up to 1 million codes per quarter. App-level promo codes will remain unaffected. Offer codes for tvOS only apps are currently not supported.

Promo codes offer potential App Store customers or reviewers a free copy of apps or In-App Purchases, including subscriptions, on iOS, macOS, or tvOS. These codes can be redeemed on any App Store storefront where your app is available. Each code remains valid for four weeks from its generation date and can be used only once.

You can distribute promo codes by any means. Purchases made using promo codes are indicated in your Sales and Trends reports.

**Note: **Promo codes can't be generated for apps available only on Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager.

## Promo codes for apps

When a customer downloads an app using a promo code, the app functions as if it were purchased. For example, the customer has the opportunity to update to new versions of the app. However, customers can’t rate or review the app. Promo codes can be used to redeem unreleased versions of apps available on the App Store. Promo codes for tvOS or multi-platform apps must be redeemed on an iOS device. After the code is redeemed, the tvOS app appears in the customer’s purchase history on the App Store for Apple TV. You can request up to 100 promo codes per version of each platform your app supports.

## Promo codes for In-App Purchases

When a customer redeems a promo code for a free app that isn’t installed on their device, the app downloads automatically. If the app is for sale, the customer needs to purchase the app to redeem the In-App Purchase. If a customer uses a promo code to subscribe to an auto-renewable subscription, the subscription won’t automatically renew after the duration is complete. You can provide up to 100 promo codes for each In-App Purchase product, with a maximum of 1,000 total codes for all In-App Purchases every six months. This limit resets on January 1 and July 1. These codes are for non-commercial use and expire 28 days after they were generated.

To request promo codes for an app version, the version’s status must be Ready for Distribution or Pending Developer Release for iOS and macOS apps, or Ready for Distribution for tvOS apps. For In-App Purchases, the In-App Purchase state must be Approved or it won't appear as an option.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, or Marketing. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Request promo codes

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.

# Reset an app overview rating

iOS
macOS
tvOS

When you release a new version of your app on the App Store, you have the option to reset its overview rating. After resetting, a message will appear on your App Store product page indicating that the rating was recently reset. Once there are enough users that have rated the new version, a new overview rating appears. You can view the reset date in the Distribution tab under Ratings and Reviews.

**Note: **Once you release the new version of your app, you won’t be able to restore the previous rating.

When you reset your app's overview rating, it affects all regions or countries simultaneously. Keep in mind that when you reset your overview rating, it won’t apply to written customer reviews, which will continue to display on the App Store.

For universal apps on the App Store, the reset only applies to the [platform version](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-platforms) that you reset your rating for. You can’t reset the rating of app bundles.

**Required role: **Admin or App Manager. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the sidebar, click the app version you want to submit.

# Schedule price changes for apps

If you’ve accepted the Paid Apps Agreement and submitted your app for review, you can schedule price changes for your app. Price changes can have definite start and end dates, or they can be permanent with no end. For example, you can set a promotional price for a month, then return to the regular price.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Global Price Change | You change the price of your app in your base country or region in App Store Connect. Apple provides comparable prices for all other countries or regions, and may adjust some prices on your behalf in the future to account for changes in taxes and foreign exchange rates. Pricing in your base country or region won't be affected. |
| Temporary Price Change | You select the start and end dates for a temporary price change in certain countries or regions. During this time, Apple won’t adjust your prices in these countries or regions. |
| Custom Price Change | You manually manage prices for some or all countries or regions. Apple won't adjust prices on your behalf in these countries or regions. |

# Select an App Store version release option

You can choose a release option for each platform version of your app in App Store Connect.

**Note: **If you’re [setting up your app for pre-order](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/publish-for-pre-order) in a country or region and haven't yet released it on the App Store, you'll need to release the app version manually. The App Store Version Release section will be dimmed and "Release the app yourself" will be automatically selected.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, or App Manager. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the sidebar, click the app version you want to set a release option for.
3. In the App Store Version Release section, select a release option:

- *Release the app yourself*: Select “Manually release this version.” (Later, manually release the version.)
- *Automatically release the app after approval*: Select “Automatically release this version.”
- *Automatically release the app but no earlier than a specified date*: Select “Automatically release this version after App Review, no earlier than” and below this option, enter a date and time.
4. On the top right of the page, click Save.

## Manually release a version to the App Store

When [submitting your app for review](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/overview-of-submitting-for-review), you can manually release a version. After approval, release it to the App Store once its status changes to Pending Developer Release.

Releasing an app version is specific to the platform you're working with. If there are app versions for other platforms also in "Pending Developer Release" that you want to release, you must manually release each one for every platform.

Apple will send you an email reminder if an app remains in Pending Developer Release status for more than 30 days.

[Learn how to manually release a version with the App Store Connect API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/app_store/app_store_version_release_requests)

2. In the sidebar, select the app version that has the status of Pending Developer Release.
3. On the top right, click Release This Version.
4. In the dialog that appears, click Confirm.

After manually releasing your app version, it may take up to 24 hours for it to appear on the App Store. To cancel the release, select Cancel This Release from the message on the version page.

 **Note: **When you choose Release This Version, the new app will publish for pre-order in countries or regions where pre-order is enabled.

You’ll need to set pricing for your In-App Purchase before you submit it for review. Choose from up to 800 price points by default, and request to access an additional 100 higher price points (up to $10,000).

You can set a price for the country or region you’re familiar with as the basis for automatically generating prices across the other 174 storefronts and 43 currencies. Automatically generated prices account for foreign exchange rates and certain taxes, and follow the most common pricing convention for each country or region.

Periodically, Apple updates prices in certain regions based on changes in taxes and foreign exchange rates. This is done using publicly available exchange rate information from financial data providers. These automatic price adjustments help ensure that your app’s price across all storefronts stays equalized with your base country or region. Automatic price updates help your global earnings stay consistent, customers aren’t incentivized to seek lower prices on certain storefronts, and pricing mistakes are reduced. Apple will never change the price in your base country or region, and will always notify you in advance of changes on other storefronts.

Alternatively, you can choose to manually manage certain storefronts or you can manually manage them all. Keep in mind that you'll be responsible for staying up to date with taxes and exchange rates in the storefronts you manually manage.

**Note: **It may take up to 1 hour for changes you make to product metadata to appear in the sandbox environment.

### Edit base country or region for your In-App Purchase

You can set the base country or region of each In-App Purchase separately from the app. Once you edit the base country or region or update the pricing of an In-App Purchase, it'll no longer inherit changes you make to the app’s base country or region.

# Set a tax category

Apple's tax calculation service uses multiple inputs to compute tax on customer transactions in countries or regions where taxes are administered. These inputs include your tax category selection in App Store Connect, app metadata, legal entity status, tax registration status, customer attributes, and other requirements in accordance with local laws and regulations.

You need to choose the category that most accurately describes each app. By default, this category applies to In-App Purchases. However, you also have the option to [set a specific category for each In-App Purchase](/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/set-a-tax-category-for-in-app-purchases). If you modify any tax category settings, it will only impact future transactions.

If you choose not to make any changes, your apps and In-App Purchases will be assigned the App Store software category. You can adjust these settings at any time as the characterization of your app or In-App Purchases change or as tax legislation changes. Ensure that the tax category settings you choose accurately represent your app's offerings. Selecting categories or attributes that aren't appropriate for your app or In-App Purchases violates your obligations under the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, the Paid Agreements, and local tax laws.

Your tax category selections may result in changes to your proceeds, as proceeds are calculated based on the price of your app or In-App Purchase, minus any applicable taxes. To view your estimated proceeds at each price tier, click All Prices and Currencies from Pricing and Availability.

**Note: ** Changes may take up to an hour to be reflected.

Compare the categories below to determine which best describes your app and/or In-App Purchases. For guidance on setting the appropriate tax category, consult your tax advisor.

| Books | Apps that sell electronic versions of printed books, or digital-only content that's published once, under a single title. For content published regularly, consider the "Magazines and other periodicals" category, or the "News publications" category. |
| Boosting | Apps and/or In-App Purchases that offer resources to provide exposure, visibility, or engagement to enhance the prominence and reach of specific content that’s experienced or consumed in app (such as videos, sales of “boosts” in social media apps, listings, and/or other forms of user-generated content). |

| Music and other audio | Apps that are for listening to audio content, including music, podcasts, meditations, radio, and ringtones. |
| News publications | Apps that provide information about current events with regular content updates. It may be a digital-first, or interactive version of a printed newspaper. If your app focuses on content about one sector, consider the "Magazines and other periodicals" category. |

| Software training material | Apps that deliver trainings on specific off-the-shelf software. |

## set-an-app-age-rating

Manage app information

# Set an app age rating

An age rating is a required [app information](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-information) property that helps users assess the content and any potentially objectionable material within your app or game. This rating supports the functionality of parental controls, allowing parents and guardians to establish a safe online environment for children. As a developer, you can deliver age-appropriate experiences tailored for users across all age groups.

To determine the age rating of your app, respond to the age rating questionnaire in App Store Connect. This questionnaire includes a list of content descriptors, in-app controls, and capabilities that allow you to specify the frequency of each content type in your app. Your selections are then translated into an Apple global age rating, as well as additional region-specific ratings if required. [Learn about age rating values and definitions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/age-ratings-values-and-definitions)

This process helps you understand how different types of content can impact your app’s rating across various regions, enabling you to make informed declarations of frequency of the content and features in your app.

Depending on your responses, an age rating is assigned to each country or region based on their specific age suitability standards. This rating will be displayed on the App Store for that country or region and will remain consistent across all platforms. Learn about age rating values with region-specific requirements for [Australia](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/age-ratings-values-and-definitions#australia-age-rating-values), [Brazil](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/age-ratings-values-and-definitions#brazil-age-rating-values), and [Korea](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/age-ratings-values-and-definitions#republic-of-korea-age-rating-values).

**Notes: **

- Age ratings for an app may vary based on the OS version. [View age range value details](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/age-ratings-values-and-definitions#age-rating-values) for Apple devices running a minimum of iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and watchOS 26. [View details](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/age-ratings-values-and-definitions#age-ratings-on-os-versions-earlier-than-26) for Apple devices running an earlier OS version.
- An Unrated app can’t be published on the App Store. It may be published on alternative app marketplaces or websites.

**Tip: **To learn more about and view examples of the features and content used to determine age ratings, select a category from the panel of examples on the App Information Page. You can also browse [Age rating categories](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/age-ratings-values-and-definitions#age-rating-categories).
3. Below Age Ratings, click the Set Up Age Ratings button.

4. When the dialog box appears, review the list of in-app controls and capabilities options, and select any that your app includes that can restrict content, then click Next.
5. Navigate through each section of the progress bar, answering the questions and selecting the appropriate level of frequency for each content description, then click Next.

![A screenshot of the 'Age Ratings' dialog box, titled 'Step 5: Chance-Based Activities'. It lists various chance-based activities for selection, such as 'Simulated Gambling' and 'Contests'.

If you don’t need to override your rating or display your app in the Kids category on the App Store, choose Not Applicable under Age Categories and Override, then proceed to Step 6.

## Age categories and override

Your calculated rating is displayed in the Additional Information section of the progress bar. If your app is for a specific age category, has a EULA with age requirements, or if you believe your app should be rated higher, you can adjust the rating to better reflect your app’s content and features by choosing Made for Kids or Override to Higher Age Rating.

### Made for Kids category on the App Store

If your calculated rating is 4+ or 9+ and you want your app to also display in the Kids category on the App Store, under Age Categories and Override, choose Made for Kids and from the menu, select the appropriate age range for your app. You can’t change this selection once your app is approved by App Review. The app and all subsequent updates will need to follow the [Kids category guidelines](/app-store/kids-apps/).

**Note: **You can’t select the Made for Kids option for visionOS apps, and apps in the Kids category can’t be made available on visionOS apps. 

### Override to higher age rating

To increase the rating of your app to a rating that exceeds the rating assigned by Apple, choose Override to Higher Age Rating and select the appropriate rating from the menu. App Store will display this specified age rating, and the content descriptions will still reflect your questionnaire answers.

If your app will be distributed through alternative app marketplaces or websites in the European Union and you believe your app is Unrated, select Unrated from the menu options under Override to Higher Age Rating.

**Note: **

- If your app has a EULA with minimum age requirements that exceed the rating that Apple calculated, you must override to a rating that adheres to the requirements.
- The override will apply in all regions where your app is available and may override to a different rating value per region based on region-specific requirements.

# Set availability for an auto-renewable subscription

You have the option to make your auto-renewable subscription available in any of 175 countries or regions where the App Store is offered. A customer’s Apple Account country or region setting determines which storefront they can purchase auto-renewable subscriptions from. For example, an account set to Japan can only purchase content from the App Store in Japan.

Keep in mind that even if you set availability for a subscription, it may not be available for purchase. Monitor the [In-App Purchase statuses](/help/app-store-connect/reference/in-app-purchases-and-subscriptions/in-app-purchase-statuses) to understand if action is needed from you, such as completing missing metadata, or if your In-App Purchase has been approved by App Review.

[Learn how to set availability for auto-renewable subscriptions with the App Store Connect API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/app_store/auto-renewable_subscriptions/managing_auto-renewable_subscriptions)

4. Click the subscription you want to set up availability for.
5. In the Availability section, click Set Up Availability.

Monitor the [In-App Purchase statuses](/help/app-store-connect/reference/in-app-purchases-and-subscriptions/in-app-purchase-statuses) to understand if action is needed from you, such as completing missing metadata, or if your In-App Purchase has been approved by App Review.

### Make changes to your auto-renewable subscription’s availability

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the sidebar, click Subscriptions.
3. On the subscriptions detail page, click the subscription group.
4. Click the subscription you want to edit availability for.
5. Under Availability, click Edit.
6. In the dialog that appears, change your subscription’s availability by selecting or deselecting your desired countries or regions. 
						
**Note: **You must be the Account Holder in order to remove countries or regions, as this will impact existing subscribers.
7. Click Done.
8. On the top right, click Save.

If you want to discontinue an auto-renewable subscription, consider the impact on users and any communications you might need to provide. Also consider whether your app still functions without the subscription. If not, remove your app from the App Store.

Keep in mind that you’re required by the Paid Apps Agreement to provide the full amount of content to eligible subscribers through the subscription duration.

Taking the following steps before removing your auto-renewable subscription from sale can help ensure a smooth experience:

- Before discontinuing an auto-renewable subscription, remove it from sale, within App Store Connect, to stop additional sign-ups and renewals. We recommend timing the removal of your subscription to be equivalent to its duration. A minimum of 31 days is required from the date subscription is removed from sale and service is stopped to allow monthly and shorter duration subscriptions to expire.
- For subscriptions longer than one month, if you're unable to provide the full amount of content to eligible subscribers through the subscription duration before removing the subscription, [contact us](https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/remove/).
- Provide subscribers with advanced notice of the discontinuation of your subscription service through channels such as email, website, and in-app messaging. We recommend notifying them at least 31 days before discontinuing the subscription service.
- End any promotions of the subscription to discourage purchases.

To remove your subscription from sale:

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the sidebar, under Monetization, click Subscriptions.
3. Click the subscription group, then the subscription.
4. Under Availability, deselect Cleared for Sale to remove your subscription from sale. Click Removing from Sale in the dialog.
5. Click Save.

Apps in the Magazines and Newspapers category need at least one active auto-renewable subscription to be listed in that category. If you want to discontinue the only auto-renewable subscription in your app, you must switch to a different category and submit a new binary to App Store Connect. Then you'll be able to remove the subscription.

## set-distribution-methods

Manage your app's availability

# Set distribution methods

In App Store Connect, you can choose between two distribution options for your app:

**Public Distribution:** Your app will be publicly available on the App Store in the [selected countries or regions](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/manage-availability-for-your-app-on-the-app-store). It can also be available to anyone for volume purchase through Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager. You can request to [change your publicly available app to an unlisted app](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/set-distribution-methods#make-your-app-available-only-through-a-direct-link) to make your app discoverable on the App Store only with a direct link.  [Learn about unlisted app distribution.](/support/unlisted-app-distribution)

**Private Distribution:** Your app will be available only on Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager to specific businesses and organizations that you specify in App Store Connect.

**Note: **Once your app is approved, the distribution method can't be changed. However, you can [change a publicly available app to an unlisted app](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/set-distribution-methods#make-your-app-available-only-through-a-direct-link). To switch from private to public distribution—or vice versa—you must create a new app record and resubmit your binary.

### Make your app available publicly on the App Store and for volume purchase

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin or App Manager. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

Apps on the App Store are automatically available for volume purchase for the same price in Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager, where businesses and educational institutions can download them for distribution in bulk.

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the sidebar, click Pricing and Availability.
3. Under App Distribution Methods, select Public.
4. To offer educational institutions a discount, select the checkbox “Offer a reduced price on Apple School Manager for volume purchases.” Your app will be available at 50% of its listed price for purchases of 20 or more units by educational institutions.
5. On the top right, click Save.

Once your app is approved, it’ll be available on the App Store in the [ selected countries or regions](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/manage-availability-for-your-app-on-the-app-store), and in the Apps and Books section of Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager.

### Make an app available only to specific businesses or organizations

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin or App Manager. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

If you don’t want individual users to be able to download your app from the App Store, you can restrict the availability of your app to only specific businesses or organizations. This includes the ability to distribute proprietary apps for internal use within your organization.

You can specify one or more organizations that can view and download the app in Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager. They can then distribute it through Mobile Device Management or redemption codes.

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the sidebar, click Pricing and Availability.
3. Under App Distribution Methods, select Private.

![Screenshot of the App Distribution Methods section, where there are two distribution method options: "Public - Discoverable by anyone on the App Store (default)" and "Private - Available as a custom app on Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager." The Public section is selected.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/set-distribution-methods/images/private-dist_2x.png)
4. Under Type, choose either Organization ID or Apple Account, and enter the required information. Enter the Organization ID to make the app visible in the organization's Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager account. For businesses still using the legacy Volume Purchase Program, you can assign an app to their volume purchasing account.
5. In the top right, click Save.

### Make your app available only through a direct link

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, or App Manager. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

Apps that aren’t suited for public distribution can be made discoverable as unlisted on the App Store with a direct link. Unlisted apps don’t show in any categories, recommendations, charts, search results, or other listings in the App Store. You can also use this direct link within Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager.

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. In the sidebar, click Pricing and Availability.
3. Under App Distribution methods, make sure your app’s availability is set to Public. If your app has been approved for private download on Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager, you must create a new app record in App Store Connect, upload your binary, and set the distribution method to Public before proceeding to the next step.
4. Submit your app for review, if you haven’t already.

**Note: **Once your app is approved, the distribution method can't be changed. The only exception to this is to change your publicly available app to an unlisted app. To switch from private to public, or vice versa, you’ll need to create a new app record and resubmit your binary.
5. To receive an unlisted link, [submit a request](/support/unlisted-app-distribution). Upon approval, your app's distribution method will change to Unlisted in the Pricing and Availability section of the app information page. Future versions of your app will remain unlisted.

### FAQs

### I currently have an app that is available privately in Apple Business Manager and I’d like to make it available publicly on the App Store, can I change my app’s distribution method?

No. Changing your app's distribution method from public to private, or vice versa, requires submitting a new app for review.

### Where can users download my app in volume?

Downloading apps in volume requires either an Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager account. Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager are available in many [countries and regions](https://support.apple.com/HT207305).

# Set up introductory offers for auto-renewable subscriptions

You can set up introductory offers for your apps on the App Store that contain auto-renewable subscriptions in App Store Connect. An introductory offer is a limited-time discounted price or free trial for the initial period of a subscription.

When you set up an introductory offer, it automatically appears on your app’s product page on the App Store for eligible users. You can also display introductory offers within your app. When displaying offers in your app, use receipt validation to ensure that you’re only showing offers to people who can redeem them. [Learn about implementing introductory offers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/original_api_for_in-app_purchase/subscriptions_and_offers/implementing_introductory_offers_in_your_app).

There are three types of introductory offers: free trial, pay up front, and pay as you go. You can choose the length of the introductory offer based on the standard subscription duration.

**Note: **It may take up to 1 hour for changes you make to product metadata to appear in the sandbox environment.

### FAQs

### What is the difference between introductory offer limits and customer eligibility limits?

App Store Connect allows you to set an introductory offer for each subscription product in App Store Connect. You can have multiple offers in each subscription group. New and returning customers are only eligible to use one introductory offer per subscription group. For example, if a customer uses a free trial and then upgrades to a subscription product in the same group that also has a free trial, they aren't eligible for the second offer.

## set-up-os-data-transfer

# Set up OS data transfer

OS data transfer allows users to seamlessly transfer your app’s data across Android and iOS by adding app IDs from your Android app in App Store Connect. During a data transfer, the user’s Android device will provide iOS a list of installed app IDs, which will be matched against what you have provided. This helps ensure that apps in the mapping table you provide are migrated.

In order to support this, you must provide your app information from Android so that we can correctly install your app. This includes your Android Package Name and the SHA-256 certificate fingerprint of your Signing Key Certificate.

You can also enable data migration by implementing [AppMigrationKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appmigrationkit).

Each iOS app can only map to one Android app from Google Play; however, you can add up to 5 app ID mappings per app.

**Note: **Users can only use OS data transfer for your app if you set it up both in App Store Connect and with Google. Additionally, users must be running iOS 26.3 or later and a version of Android that also supports OS data transfer.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, or App Manager. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/role-permissions)

# Set up promotional offers for auto-renewable subscriptions

Apps on the App Store with auto-renewable subscriptions can provide a discounted price for a specific duration for existing and previously subscribed customers on iOS, macOS, and tvOS. You can use these offers to help win back subscribers who canceled their subscriptions or promote an upgrade to a higher-ranked subscription at a special price. Customers can accept the offer even if they've already accepted an introductory offer.

To get started, [generate keys for In-App Purchases](/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/generate-keys-for-in-app-purchases), create a promotional offer on your app's In-App Purchase page for each product, and choose a duration and offer type [(pay as you go, pay up front, free)](/help/app-store-connect/reference/pricing-and-availability/in-app-purchase-and-subscriptions-pricing-and-availability). You can have up to 10 active offers per subscription.

Once you've created offers in App Store Connect, use Xcode 10.2 or later to implement the [StoreKit APIs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/implementing_subscription_offers_in_your_app) to allow these offers to be accepted by customers running iOS 12.2, macOS 10.14.4, and tvOS 12.2, or later.

**Note: **It may take up to 1 hour for changes you make to product metadata to appear in the sandbox environment.

## set-up-subscription-offer-codes

Manage subscriptions

# Set up subscription offer codes

If you offer auto-renewable subscriptions on the App Store, you can set up offer codes to provide people with a free or discounted price for a specific duration and help you acquire, retain, and win back subscribers. You can create codes for a maximum of 1 million redemptions per app, per
quarter.

There are two types of offer codes:

### One-time-use codes

- Unique, one-time-use codes that customers redeem through a redemption URL, by entering the code in the [App Store code redemption flow](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118242), or within your app.
- Customers are limited to redeeming one code per offer.
- Redeemable by customers within your app if they’re using a device running iOS 14, iPadOS 14, or macOS 15, or later and your app supports the appropriate StoreKit method. [Learn more](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/supporting_subscription_offer_codes_in_your_app).
- Useful for small-scale distribution or when code access needs to be restricted.
- Each app can have up to 1 million codes per quarter, shared across all subscriptions.
- Expire after a maximum of six months from the date they’re created.

### Custom codes

- Uniquely named custom codes — for example, SPRINGPROMO — that customers redeem through a redemption URL or within your app.
- Customers are limited to redeeming one code per offer.
- Redeemable by customers within your app if they’re using a device running iOS 14, iPadOS 14, or macOS 15, or later and your app supports the appropriate StoreKit method. [Learn more](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/supporting_subscription_offer_codes_in_your_app).
- Ideal for large campaigns that require mass distribution.
- An expiration date isn't required for custom codes. You can optionally set a maximum redemption limit and/or expiration date.
- Each app can have up to 1 million codes per quarter, shared across all subscriptions.

Customer eligibility is determined by you in App Store Connect and can include customers with new, active, and expired subscriptions. Consider your offer’s eligibility requirements before creating and distributing offer codes.

(Checking the box will prevent auto-renewal, ensuring customers receive a commitment-free trial subscription. If you choose this option, you’ll only be able to choose Free offers).

- **New subscribers:** Customers who have never subscribed to any subscription product within the group.
- **Existing subscribers:** Customers who are currently subscribed to a product within the group.

10. If your subscription has an introductory offer, determine whether people redeeming your codes should be eligible to redeem both a code and the introductory offer by choosing from the following options:

- **Yes.** Eligible customers will redeem your app’s introductory offer first, then automatically renew to the offer they redeemed with the code. (If you've disabled auto-renewal, you won’t be able to choose this option).
- **No.** Eligible customers will redeem the offer code first, then automatically renew to the standard subscription price without using the introductory offer. If they cancel and resubscribe at any point, they’re still eligible to redeem an introductory offer.

13. Choose [Pay as you go, Pay up front, or Free](/help/app-store-connect/reference/pricing-and-availability/in-app-purchase-and-subscriptions-pricing-and-availability). (If you've opted to disable auto-renewal, you'll only have the option to make your offer free.)
14. Choose the appropriate duration, and if applicable, the discounted price for a base country or region, then click Next. To search from a larger list of price points,click See Additional Prices.

App Store Connect provides comparable prices for all 175 App Store countries and regions, taking into account taxes and foreign exchange rates. If you want to set different prices for specific storefronts, make the changes and click Next.

- **Give codes to customers directly:** Codes can be shared through online or offline channels. For example, you might print the codes on cards that you give out at an event. People can redeem one-time use codes by entering them in the “Redeem Gift Card or Code” page in their App Store account settings, or redeem custom codes within your app if you’ve implemented the appropriate StoreKit method. [Learn more](/app-store/subscriptions/#offer-codes).
- **Create a unique redemption URL:** Codes can be used to create redemption URLs that you can share directly. When someone visits the URL, they'll land on a page where they can redeem your code. People who haven't installed your app will first be prompted to download the app before redeeming the code.

To create these URLs for one-time use codes, copy the example link from your offer details page, then add each code to the end of the URL. One-time use code URLs are also included in the downloadable text file.

## set-up-win-back-offers

Manage subscriptions

# Set up win-back offers

If your app offers auto-renewable subscriptions, you have the option to set up win-back offers to encourage lapsed subscribers to re-subscribe on the App Store. You can configure offers in App Store Connect to be displayed to eligible customers on your product page and in your app. They may also appear in editorially curated selections and personalized recommendations across the App Store.

App Store Connect allows you to create a maximum of 350 win-back offers per subscription. You can run a maximum of 5 win-back offers per storefront, per subscription at a time.

[Learn more about offers for auto-renewable subscriptions.](/app-store/whats-new/)

[Learn about supporting win-back offers in your app.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/supporting_win-back_offers_in_your_app)

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, or Marketing. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Set up win-back offers

1. From Apps, select your app.
2. In the sidebar, click Subscriptions.
3. Choose the subscription group containing your subscription. Your subscription needs to be approved by App Review before you can create a win-back offer.
4. Click the subscription, then go to the Subscription Prices section and click the add button (+).
5. Select Create Win-Back Offer.
6. Enter a reference name for the offer. Use this reference name to manage the offer in App Store Connect. After you’ve created your offer, the reference name cannot be changed.
7. Enter an identifier for the offer.  This will allow you to identify sales associated with the offer in Sales and Trends reports and in StoreKit transactions. It must not have already been used for another offer in the same subscription group. After you’ve created your offer,  you can’t change the offer identifier.
8. Set the date range for when this offer will be available. The earliest you can schedule your offer to go live is one day after today, and the event must run for a minimum of 3 days. Please note that [start dates and times vary by region](/help/app-store-connect/reference/pricing-and-availability/app-store-pricing-and-availability-start-times-by-country-or-region).
9. Choose either Normal Priority or High Priority. Indicating an offer is high priority helps the App Store understand which of your offers are your most important business priorities. Along with other offer details, this informs how Apple ranks your offer in placements such as win-back offer sheets, customers' manage subscriptions page, and the App Store if you choose to promote your offer there.
10. Determine which customers are eligible for the offer, based on how long they were paid subscribers and when their subscriptions ended.

| Eligibility Criteria | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Minimum Paid Duration | The minimum time that a customer must have been subscribed to that subscription in order to be eligible for the offer. Choose any value between 1 and 24 months, or 3, 4, and 5 years. |
| Time Since Last Subscribed | The range of months that must have passed since the customer last had an active subscription. You can choose a minimum value of 1 month and a maximum value of 24 months. For example, selecting a minimum of 5 months and a maximum of 11 months will configure your offer to be shown only to customers who have been lapsed for 5 to 11 months. Both a minimum and maximum value are required. |
| Wait Between Offers | The required time a customer must wait after a win-back offer ends before redeeming the same offer again. Choose a value between 2 and 24 months. This field is optional. |
11. Choose your country or region availability, then click Next.

App Store Connect informs you if your offer overlaps with any other scheduled offers. Overlap occurs when customers are eligible for more than one offer for the same subscription, based on specified offer dates, eligibility criteria, and country or region availability. If offers overlap, Apple automatically selects and displays one offer to eligible customers based on price, duration, and other factors such as the customer’s paid subscription tenure.
12. Choose Pay as you go, Pay up front, or Free, then choose the appropriate duration and price. To search from a larger list of price points, click See Additional Prices. Click Next.
13. App Store Connect provides comparable prices for all 175 App Store countries and regions, taking into account taxes and foreign exchange rates. If you want to set different prices for specific storefronts, make the changes and click Next.  After you’ve created your offer, you can’t change the price.
14. Make sure the details of your offer are correct, and then click Confirm. After the offer is created, a redemption URL to the offer is generated. The offer will automatically display on the customers' Manage Subscriptions page and within your app once the start date is reached. In order for your offer to appear on the App Store, make sure you have an [approved image](/help/app-store-connect/manage-in-app-purchases/view-and-edit-in-app-purchase-information#add-or-remove-an-image) for your subscription, and have [promoted the offer](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/set-up-win-back-offers#promote-win-back-offers-on-the-app-store).

### Promote win-back offers on the App Store

In order for your win-back offer to appear on your app’s product page and in editorially curated selections and personalized recommendations across the App Store, you must promote it. To promote an offer on the App Store, make sure you have an [subscription image](/help/app-store-connect/manage-in-app-purchases/view-and-edit-in-app-purchase-information#add-or-remove-an-image) for your subscription approved by App Review.

![](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/set-up-win-back-offers/images/promote-win-back-offers-on-the-app-store_2x.png)

The App Store will display your image on a win-back offer sheet alongside your app icon, subscription display name, and description. You may not upload an image that is the same as your app icon, or any of your app screenshots.

1. From Apps, select your app.
2. In the sidebar, click Subscriptions
3. Choose the subscription group containing your subscription.
4. Click the subscription you wish to promote.

6. Click Promote.

If you choose to promote a win-back offer, it will replace any [In-App Purchase promotions](/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/promote-in-app-purchases) in the same storefront.

### Display offers to eligible subscribers

You can manage how the win-back offer sheet is displayed in your app using [StoreKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/message).

If you choose to [promote your win-back offer](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/set-up-win-back-offers#promote-win-back-offers-on-the-app-store), it appears on your app’s product page and in editorially curated selections and personalized recommendations across the App Store on macOS 15, iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 and later. (Please note that even if you do not promote your win-back offer, it will still appear in customers’ Manage Subscriptions page and [within your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/supporting_win-back_offers_in_your_app)) 

![](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/set-up-win-back-offers/images/display-offers-to-eligible-subscribers1_2x.png)

You can also market win-back offers to eligible customers by sharing a redemption URL to your offer with them (such as through an email or website), or merchandise the offer within your app using [StoreKit 2 APIs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/supporting_win-back_offers_in_your_app).

![](/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/set-up-win-back-offers/images/display-offers-to-eligible-subscribers2_2x.png)

1. From Apps, select your app.
2. In the sidebar, click Subscriptions
3. Choose the subscription group containing your subscription.

## set-your-developer-name

Create an app record

# Set your developer name

By default, your legal name is used as your developer name. If you enrolled in the Apple Developer Program as an organization, you can set a different developer name if it's a registered trade name, DBA, or fictitious business name. For example, if your legal name is “Apps Company LLC”, your trade name can simply be “Apps Company”, which is used for distribution.

If you’re enrolled as an individual, this option isn’t available to you and the developer name is the same as your legal name.

You can set your developer name only when adding an app to your account for the first time. You can't edit or update this name later, so it's important to enter it correctly.

1. In Apps, click the Add button (+).

The Apps page is blank until you create your first app.
2. In the pop-up window, enter your developer name into the Company Name field.
3. Fill in the other required details, then click Create.

Once your app is approved, your developer name appears under your app name on App Store product pages and displays when users install your app.

## store-services-tiers-in-the-eu

Reference

# Store Services tiers in the EU

Worldwide, the App Store’s single commission on digital goods and services is designed to reflect the many ways Apple creates value for developers. This includes everything from App Store distribution and discovery, secure payment processing, and commerce services, to the trusted and secure platforms and all the tools and technology to build and share innovative apps with users around the world.

By default, apps on the App Store are provided Store Services Tier 2, the complete suite of all capabilities designed to maximize visibility, engagement, growth, and operational efficiency. Developers with [apps on the App Store in the EU](/support/alternative-payment-options-on-the-app-store-in-the-eu/) that communicate and promote offers for digital goods and services can choose to move their apps to only use Store Services Tier 1 and pay a reduced store services fee.

- **Store Services Tier 1:** This tier provides capabilities needed for app delivery, trust & safety, app management, and engagement; and features a reduced store services fee. This tier is mandatory for apps communicating and promoting offers.
- **Store Services Tier 2:** This tier is optional, and provides additional capabilities for app delivery and management, engagement, curation & personalization, app insights, and developer marketing.

Developers can move an app between tiers on a per-app, per-storefront basis once a quarter. If you’d like to update your app’s services tier, the Account Holder of your program membership can [submit an update form](/contact/request/store-services-tiers/).

If you want to submit a custom product page and your app hasn’t been approved yet, include the custom product page in the same submission as your first iOS app version. If your app is already approved, you can choose to submit a custom product page with or without an iOS app version. You can also add other items to a submission.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, or Marketing. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### Sample Subscriber Report

### Purchases

Report on Day 1 of Initial Purchase

| Title | Subscriber ID | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Month Basic | 7890 | 1 | 7 | 9.99 |

Report on Renewal the Next Month

| Title | Subscriber ID | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Month Basic | 7890 | 1 | 7 | 9.99 |

The first time a customer purchases a subscription from you, a Subscriber ID is created. The same ID is reported for subsequent purchases from the same customer.

For example, Report on Day 1 of Initial Purchase shows a purchase of a 1-month subscription from a customer that is given Subscriber ID 7890. The same customer renews the next month with the same Subscriber ID.

## Subscriber ID Reset

Report on Day 1 of Initial Purchase

| Title | Subscriber ID | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Month Basic | 7890 | 1 | 7 | 9.99 |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Month Premium | 54321 | Yes | 1 | 21 | 29.99 |

If a customer cancels all of their subscriptions with you and does not resubscribe within 180 days, the Subscriber ID will be deleted. If the same customer resubscribes after 180 days, then we create a new Subscriber ID.

For example, Report on Day 1 of Initial Purchase shows a purchase of a 1-month subscription from a customer that is given Subscriber ID 7890. The same customer cancels after the first month and subscribes again 181 days later. The corresponding report shows a new Subscriber ID of 54321 along with an indication that the previous ID has been reset.

## Subscriber Upgrade with Partial Credit

Report on Day 1 of Initial Purchase

| Title | Subscriber ID | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Month Basic | 7890 | 1 | 7 | 9.99 |

| 1 Month Premium | 7890 | 1 | 21 | 29.99 |  |

When a subscriber upgrades, the pro-rated credit is refunded and the new subscription is charged at full price, as long as the credit is not greater than the new price.

For example, Report on Day 1 shows a sale of a 1-month subscription for 9.99. On Day 25, the subscriber upgrades to a subscription priced at 29.99. Note that the upgrade goes into effect immediately. The pro-rated credit of 1.67 (9.99/30 days x 5 days left) is refunded and the full price of 29.99 is charged.

# Sufficient Contrast evaluation criteria

iOS
macOS
tvOS
visionOS
watchOS

### Description

Sufficient Contrast helps users whose vision is reduced due to a disability or situational impairment such as bright sunlight. Users can increase or adjust the contrast between text or iconography and the background, improving readability.

### Goals

Everyone should be able to use your app, regardless of whether they have a disability. The goal of the Sufficient Contrast feature is to support low-vision users who may have reduced visual acuity, clarity, and/or contrast perception.

The following sections provide more detail about how to determine whether your app supports Sufficient Contrast well. The goal is to help ensure users with disabilities can leverage all common tasks of the app, therefore performing this evaluation will help you determine whether to indicate your app Supports **Sufficient Contrast** on the App Store.

### Getting started with testing

The accessibility settings for each device include a number of features that can help users customize contrast to fit their needs. Most users that have a need for higher contrast will enable the settings for *Bold Text*, *Increase Contrast*, and *Reduce Transparency*. You’re not required to use the built-in system settings, but testing with them on may give you an understanding of the contrast minimums your users expect. If you offer your own in-app setting, it should either support similar functionality to the systemwide settings, or offer more granular user interface customization.

Enable all three settings before testing your app for sufficient contrast. Review the resources below for details about turning on these settings for each device your app supports.

- For iPhone, visit [Change display colors on iPhone to make it easier to see what’s onscreen](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iph3e2e1fb0).

You can check the contrast of elements in your app by using Xcode’s [Accessibility Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accessibility/accessibility-inspector) or other color contrast checkers to determine contrast ratios for elements in your app. Most modern accessibility guidelines recommend a minimum contrast ratio of “4.5 to 1 between foreground text and its background” based on a formula provided by the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html).

If your app supports Dark Mode, be sure to check the minimum contrast in both light and dark modes. A common mistake is supporting sufficient contrast in your light mode interface, but forgetting to support sufficient contrast in a dark interface. Many developers use gray-on-black for dark mode reading, which can reduce eye strain for standard vision in low-light scenarios, but this reduced contrast variant may be more difficult to read for those with low vision or light sensitivity. Consider testing your app while combining the dark mode color scheme alongside the Increase Contras setting.

Consider not only contrast, but also translucency (opacity/blurring) of your background materials, controls, and content. Include legibility of text, icons, and other content, elements, and controls in your evaluation. Remember to test with Increase Contrast on and Reduce Transparency off, and with both settings on.

Make sure to provide sufficient contrast on interactive controls and non-text representations of a state, such as a selection. For example, if you design a custom checkbox, make sure there is sufficient contrast between the checked and unchecked states. Meeting a 3:1 minimum contrast ratio is commonly recommended for non-text contrast.

If you don’t have an existing proficiency in testing sufficient contrast, take some time to go beyond the basics. Review [Strive to meet color contrast minimum standards](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility#Vision) in the Human Interface Guidelines to understand if the contrast of adjacent colors in your UI meets minimum acceptable levels.

## Indicating support for Sufficient Contrast

You may indicate your app supports Sufficient Contrast if the user interface for your common tasks, including text, buttons, and other controls, meets general contrast guidelines by default — usually 4.5 to 1 for most text elements.

If your app doesn't provide this minimum contrast by default: 

- If your app uses Apple-provided UI frameworks, verify that the Increase Contrast setting applies sufficient contrast.
- If your app supports custom frameworks, provide users with a choice of multiple color schemes that meet contrast minimums.
- If third-party or user-generated content is required in your common tasks, refer to the detailed guidance for third-party content on the [Overview of Accessibility Nutrition Labels](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels#tips).

Even after you’re able to indicate support for Sufficient Contrast in the common tasks of your app, there are likely further improvements you’ll be able to make to the accessibility of your app. Re-evaluate your app’s support for Sufficient Contrast every time you update the app. Set a goal to make your app more accessible to more people in every release.

## Subscription Upgrade with Partial Credit (for sales before November 17, 2016).

Report on Day 1 of Initial Purchase

| Title | Product Type Identifier | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Month Basic | 1AY | 1 | 7.00 | 9.99 |

Report on Day 25 of Upgrade

| Title | Product Type Identifier | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Month Premium | 1AY | 1 | 19.83 | 28.32 |

When a subscriber upgrades, any remaining credit is applied to the cost of the new subscription, as long as the credit is not greater than the new price.

For example, Report on Day 1 shows a sale of a 1-month subscription for 9.99. On Day 25, the subscriber upgrades to a subscription priced at 29.99. Note that the upgrade goes into effect immediately. Because the pro-rated credit of 1.67 (9.99/30 days x 5 days left) is less than 29.99, the cost of the new subscription is recorded at only 28.32 (29.99 - 1.67).

## Subscription Upgrade with Partial Credit (for sales after November 17, 2016).

Report on Day 1 of Initial Purchase

| Title | Product Type Identifier | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Month Basic | 1AY | 1 | 7.00 | 9.99 |

Report on Day 25 of Upgrade

| Title | Product Type Identifier | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Month Premium | 1AY | 1 | 21 | 29.99 |
| 1 Month Basic | 1AY | -1 | 1.17 | -1.67 |

When a subscriber upgrades, the pro-rated credit is refunded and the new subscription is charged at full price, as long as the credit is not greater than the new price.

For example, Report on Day 1 shows a sale of a 1-month subscription for 9.99. On Day 25, the subscriber upgrades to a subscription priced at 29.99. Note that the upgrade goes into effect immediately. The pro-rated credit of 1.67 (9.99/30 days x 5 days left) is refunded and the full price of 29.99 is charged.

## Subscription Upgrade with Full Credit

Report on Day 1 of Initial Purchase

| Title | Product Type Identifier | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Month Basic | 1AY | 1 | 21.00 | 29.99 |

Report on Day 15 of Upgrade

| Title | Product Type Identifier | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Month Premium | 1AY | -1 | 10.50 | -15.00 |
| 1 Month Basic | 1AY | 1 | 7.00 | 9.99 |

When a subscriber upgrades and the remaining credit is greater than the cost of the new subscription then a refund is issued.

For example, Report on Day 1 shows a purchase of a 1-month subscription for 29.99. On Day 15, the subscriber upgrades to a 1-month subscription priced at 9.99. Because the pro-rated credit of 15.00 (29.99/30 days x 15 days left) is greater than 9.99, a full refund is issued for -15.00 and a new sale for 9.99 is recorded.

## Developer codes

| Title | Product Type Identifier | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price | Promo Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App Two | 1F | 5 | 0 | 0 | CR-RW |

This row shows five sales in which customers used a developer code. Developer Proceeds and Customer Price are 0. The Promo Code column value will be “CR-RW.”

## Completed app bundles

| Row | Title | Product Type Identifier | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price | CMB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | App Bundle One | 1-B | 25 | 2.10 | 2.99 | CMB |
| 2 | App One | 1F | -25 | .70 | -.99 | CMB-C |
| 3 | App Two | 1F | -25 | .70 | -.99 | CMB-C |

A completed paid app bundle purchase creates two types of records:

- One record for the bundle itself, indicated by the Product Type Identifier column value “1-B” (for iOS apps), or “F1-B” (for macOS apps) and the CMB column value “CMB”
- A record for credits for the previously purchased apps, indicated by the CMB column value “CMB-C”

Every paid app CMB record has one or more corresponding CMB-C records. The Customer Price of the CMB record plus the sum of the corresponding CMB-C records equals the price the customer paid for completing the bundle. Credits, like refunds, have negative values for Units and Customer Price, and positive values for Developer Proceeds.

Row 1 shows 25 app bundle purchases. The previously purchased apps are shown as credits in rows 2 and 3, as indicated by the value “CMB-C” in the CMB column. Customers paid 1.01 USD to complete the bundle (2.99 + -.99 + -.99).

Please note, in the case of a free app CMB record, a negative unit value row will not be created for previously downloaded apps. Instead, the report will show only the record for the free app bundle purchase.

## App updates

| Title | Version | Product Type Identifier | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App Three | 2.4.9 | 7F | 75 | 0 | 0 |

## Introductory Offers and Subscription Offers

Report on day of purchase 

| Title | Product Type Identifier | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price | Order Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 Month Basic | 1AY | 1 | 7.99 | 9.99 | Pay Up Front Intro Offer |
| 3 Month Basic | 1AY | 1 | .07 | 0.99 | ExampleOfferID |

When a subscriber signs up for a pay up front introductory offer, the event is shown in the Summary Sales Report. In the example above, a subscriber purchases a 3 Month Basic pay up front introductory offer. Another subscriber redeems a subscription offer for the same SKU and the Order Type column is populated with the Promotional Offer ID.

## Pre-Orders

Report on day of purchase

| Title | Units | Developer Proceeds | Customer Price | Order Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App One | 1 | 0.7 | 0.99 | Pre-Order |
| App One | 1 | 0.7 | 0.99 |  |

App One has 1 unit that originated from a pre-order, and another unit that originated after the app went live. Units that originated from a pre-order will have “Pre-Order” in the Order Type column. Units that were not from pre-orders will either have a blank field in the Order Type column, or be populated with a different Order Type value (such as a value for an Introductory Offer).

Archiving an asset pack removes all versions of that asset pack, including those being tested in TestFlight and live on the App Store. Archived asset packs can’t be restored, and the associated asset pack IDs can’t be reused.

You can’t archive asset packs that have a version with any of the following [statuses](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-uploads/apple-hosted-asset-pack-statuses):

**TestFlight statuses**

- Processing
- Waiting for Review
- In Review

**App Store statuses**

- Ready for Review
- Waiting for Review
- In Review
- Accepted
- Rejected

Asset packs can’t be archived when the app they are associated with is in the process of being transferred to another account.

## testflight-overview

Test a beta version

# TestFlight Overview

iOS
macOS
visionOS
tvOS
watchOS

TestFlight lets you distribute beta builds of your app, manage beta testers, and collect feedback. [Learn more.](/testflight/) 

Make improvements to your app and continue distributing builds until all issues are resolved before you [submit your app for review](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/overview-of-submitting-for-review).

To use [TestFlight for Mac](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664), build your macOS apps with Xcode 13 or later. If your app includes an App Clip, you can invite testers to [test the App Clip experience](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/test-an-app-clip-experience) on its own. Testers who are invited to test your app can test both the app and the App Clip. Either the app or the App Clip can be installed on a device at a time. Testers can choose to switch between them at any time.

[Learn how to manage beta testing using the App Store Connect API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/prerelease_versions_and_beta_testers)

### Step 1: Provide test information

[Provide test information](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/provide-test-information) about your app, such as a beta app description, an explanation of features to test, and an email address where feedback can be submitted. You can also choose to show approved app screenshots and your app category.

### Step 2: Upload your build or assets

[Upload your build to App Store Connect.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/upload-builds) Read Cryptography and US export compliance to determine if you need to [provide app encryption documentation](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/overview-of-export-compliance) for your app. You can test a build for up to 90 days.

**Note: **For builds to be eligible for TestFlight, they must include application identifiers within the provisioning profiles.

You also have the option to upload assets that are managed separately from a build by using [Apple-Hosted Background Assets](/help/app-store-connect/manage-asset-packs/overview-of-apple-hosted-asset-packs).

### Step 3: Invite internal and external testers

[Create groups](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/add-internal-testers#create-a-group) for testers, then assign specific builds to them. After you've added builds to a group, you can add [external testers](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/invite-external-testers) (up to 10,000 people) and [internal testers](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/add-internal-testers) (up to 100 App Store Connect users with access to your content) to test your app. If you invite external testers, your beta build may require review. When you add the first build of your app to a group, the build gets sent to App Review to make sure it follows the [App Review Guidelines](/app-store/review/guidelines/). A review is required only for the first build. Subsequent builds may not require a full review. Testing can begin once a build is approved.

**Note: **[Managed Apple Accounts](https://support.apple.com/HT210737) created in reserved domains can’t be used to test builds. Learn more about reserved domains in [Apple School Manager](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-school-manager/add-and-verify-a-domain-axm48c3280c0/web), [Apple Business Manager](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-manager/add-and-verify-a-domain-axm48c3280c0/web), or [Apple Business Essentials](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-essentials/add-and-verify-a-domain-axm48c3280c0/web).

### Step 4: Testers download TestFlight and accept your invitations

Testers install the free TestFlight app on their devices. Then they use their invitation email or a public link to accept invitations, install your app, send feedback, and get updates. Testers download and install thinned variants of your app.

**Note: **Setting specific criteria for your public link invitations can limit the number of external testers who can test your app.

### Step 5: View tester and build information

Track tester engagement and your app's performance by [viewing build status and metrics](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/view-build-status-and-metrics). These metrics include the number of sessions and crashes. Also, you can resend email invitations to testers who haven't accepted their invitation.
	

### Step 6: Collect feedback from testers

Testers using TestFlight version 2.3 or later on iOS, macOS, and visionOS can submit feedback either through the TestFlight app or by taking a screenshot directly within your beta app. You can view this [tester feedback](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/view-tester-feedback) in the TestFlight Feedback section in App Store Connect. Testers running tvOS or earlier versions of iOS can send feedback to the email address you specified in step 1.

### Step 7: Stop testing

When testing is complete, you have the option to [expire a build](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/stop-testing-a-build) to stop testing it. If you don’t expire your build and [submit it to the App Store](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/overview-of-publishing-your-app-on-the-app-store), testers who received an invitation to test will still be able to test your build even after it goes live on the App Store. Your build becomes unavailable for testers after 90 days.

# Testing subscriptions and In-App Purchases in TestFlight

### Subscription renewal rate in TestFlight

When testing your app's subscriptions in TestFlight, the renewal rate is accelerated. Each subscription is renewed daily, up to 6 times within a 1-week period, regardless of the subscription's duration.

[Learn more about testing In-App Purchases with sandbox.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/testing_in-app_purchases_with_sandbox)

**Important: **To test different renewal rates in TestFlight, you can use your Sandbox Apple Account. [Learn more about managing Sandbox Apple Account settings.](/help/app-store-connect/test-in-app-purchases/manage-sandbox-apple-account-settings)

**Renewal for all durations**

|  | 1 week | 1 month | 2 months | 3 months | 6 months | 1 year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Subscription renewal speed | 1 Day | 1 Day | 1 Day | 1 Day | 1 Day | 1 Day |

**Example scenario: **If you start a 1-month subscription on February 1st, it'll renew every 24 hours for a total of 6 renewals before being canceled. Since subscriptions renew at an accelerated rate in TestFlight, you'll see a new transaction for each renewal on February 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th. The subscription's auto-renewal will then be disabled on February 8th.

**Note: **To test subscriptions entering or exiting billing retry, you must test with a Sandbox Apple Account to subscribe and use the sandbox account settings to simulate this scenario. [Learn more about testing failing subscription renewals and In-App Purchases.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/testing_in-app_purchases_with_sandbox/testing_failing_subscription_renewals_and_in-app_purchases)

### Test In-App Purchase scenarios in TestFlight with your Sandbox Apple Account

Apps downloaded from TestFlight will automatically operate in a sandbox environment. However, to test different In-App Purchase scenarios in TestFlight, you can use your Sandbox Apple Account. First, sign out of your production Apple Account under Media & Purchases. Then, go to Developer settings and sign in with your Sandbox Apple Account to access the sandbox controls for testing.

## understanding-taxes

Making payments to Apple

# Understanding taxes

As is standard for business transactions, commissions and fees don’t include taxes. There may be applicable taxes, as required by tax law, added as new lines on your invoice. Taxes may apply in certain countries and/or regions, including but not limited to, value-added tax (VAT), sales and use tax, sales and service tax (SST), goods and services tax (GST), consumption tax, etc. Generally, the applicability of tax depends on a combination of factors:

- Your business location (your legal entity address provided when enrolling in the Apple Developer Program).
- Tax information that you provide to Apple (such as valid tax ID, exemption status, etc.).
- The billing Apple legal entity.

In the event that any amount payable by you to Apple for commissions and fees is subject to any applicable withholding tax, and that you’re required to collect and remit such tax, you shall gross up the relevant payment to Apple, so that after you deduct and remit the applicable withholding tax to tax authority, Apple shall receive the same amount as originally invoiced. You shall bear full responsibility for such compliance obligations. If you apply any applicable withholding tax, please properly indicate on any withholding tax documentation the correct Apple legal entity issuing the specific invoice and provide Apple with tax remittance documentation.

For details, view the Developer Program License Agreement, the [Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/download/alternate_eu_terms_addendum.pdf), or the [StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement Addendum for EU Apps](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/download/external/StoreKit-External-Purchase-Link-(EU)-Entitlement-Addendum.pdf). If you have questions, consult your tax adviser.

Some countries require a business status to be part of the program, so you may be required to provide tax information to prove you can be treated as a business-to-business customer. Learn about tax forms for [alternative payment options](/help/app-store-connect/manage-tax-information/provide-tax-information-for-alternative-payment-options) and the [Core Technology Fee](/help/app-store-connect/manage-tax-information/provide-tax-information-for-core-technology-fee).

### Tax on alternative payment transactions

For In-App Purchases made using alternative payment processing or linking out to a webpage, you're responsible for taxes, including (but not limited to):

- Determining if a transaction is taxable;
- Charging and collecting the taxes at the applicable rate;
- Remitting the taxes to the appropriate taxing authority;
- Providing any required documentation to the users or appropriate taxing authority; and
- Meeting all other country-specific tax compliance obligations imposed as a result of making in-app sales subject to tax in the storefront country and/or your country of residence.

If you're using alternative payment processing or linking out on a European Union (EU) storefront, you must provide Apple with an EU specific VAT ID that demonstrates you're registered to handle VAT payments. Only one EU VAT ID is necessary for all EU storefronts.

## Apple legal entities

[Learn how to upload assets using the App Store Connect API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/uploading_assets_to_app_store_connect)

If your app's user interface is the same across multiple device sizes and localizations, provide only the highest resolution screenshots required. They automatically scale down to smaller device sizes.

If you prefer not to use scaled versions, you can add specific screenshots and app previews for other device sizes and localizations using Media Manager. If a localized app preview is missing for [your localized metadata](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/localize-app-information), the app preview in the next best available language will be used on App Store product pages and displayed to users when they install your app.

For marketing guidelines, visit [*Creating your product page*](/app-store/product-page/) or [*Show more with app previews*](/app-store/app-previews/).

### Screenshot requirements:

You can upload a minimum of one and a maximum of ten screenshots in `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, and `.png` formats.

### App preview requirements:

Providing an app preview is optional. You can upload up to three app previews per supported device size and language for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS apps. To create and upload an app preview, you must have:

- A Mac running macOS 10.10 or later, with Safari 8 or later.
- A video editor, such as iMovie or Final Cut Pro X.
- An iPhone with a 6.5-inch display and iOS 8 or later installed, an iPad with a 13-inch display and iOS 8 or later installed, an Apple TV, or an Apple Vision Pro.

[Learn how to create videos for app previews.](/support/app-previews/)

When you upload your app previews, keep the following in mind:

- App previews always precede screenshots on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, even if you rearrange them when editing the app record.
- `.mov`, `.m4v`, `.mp4` formats are accepted for app previews in H.264 and `.mov` format for ProRes 422 (HQ only).
- You [set the app preview poster frame](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-information/set-an-app-preview-poster-frame), which is the image that displays to customers on App Store product pages and when users install your app.
- After you upload your app previews, processing may take up to 24 hours.
- App previews aren't available on the App Store for iMessage.
- For iOS apps, you can upload app previews in Landscape or Portrait mode. When the customer plays the video, the app preview rotates to the original orientation. For macOS, tvOS, and visionOS apps, you can only provide app previews in landscape.

Manage asset packs

# Upload Apple-hosted asset packs

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, or Developer. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

If you’re using Managed Background Assets and choose to have Apple host the assets on your behalf, you can use Transporter, the App Store Connect API, iTMSTransporter, or altool to upload asset packs to App Store Connect for testing in TestFlight and distribution on the App Store.

After you upload an asset pack, it needs to be processed in Apple’s system before it appears in App Store Connect. You’ll receive an email when this process is complete.

The Asset Pack ID you set in the manifest file, along with the app it belongs to, are used to uniquely identify the asset pack throughout the system. Its associated version number will increment automatically with each new asset pack version you upload.

[Learn how to upload asset packs using the App Store Connect API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/managing-apple-hosted-background-assets)

### Upload asset packs with Transporter

Transporter is a macOS app that provides a drag and drop way to upload content to App Store Connect for distribution. You can view delivery progress including warnings, errors, delivery logs, and a history of past deliveries.

You can download the latest version of Transporter [on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/transporter/id1450874784?mt=12).

Visit [Transporter Help](https://help.apple.com/itc/transporter/) for more information.

### Upload asset packs with iTMSTransporter

iTMSTransporter is a command-line interface that can be installed on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

**Note: **Starting in 2026, you’ll be required to use the -assetFile command instead of the -f command with your .ipa or .pkg files. Additionally, to continue uploading apps using the Aspera and Signiant delivery methods, you’ll be required to use a version of Transporter that will be released later this year.

Visit the [Transporter User Guide](https://help.apple.com/itc/transporteruserguide/en.lproj/static.html) to download iTMSTransporter and view more information.

### Upload asset packs with altool

You can use `xcrun` (included with Xcode) to invoke altool, a command-line tool that lets you validate and upload asset packs to App Store Connect. Specify the following in Terminal at the command-line:

`$ xcrun altool --upload-asset-pack asset_pack --apple-id apple-id -u username [-p password] `

## upload-builds

Manage builds

# Upload builds

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, or Developer. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

After [adding an app to your account](/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/add-a-new-app), you can upload a build using Xcode, Swift Playground, altool, or Transporter. If you use the [App Store Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi), you might want to upload your binary using the Transporter command-line tool and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication. You can use the same JWTs that you use for the API to upload your binary. As your app changes, you can upload more builds, [distribute a build for testing](/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/testflight-overview), or [submit your app for review](/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/overview-of-submitting-for-review).

The first time you upload a build, a beta version of the app is created in your account. However, the build needs to be processed in Apple’s system before it appears in App Store Connect. You’ll receive an email when this process is complete.

Each time you upload a build, the bundle ID and version number, which are located in the app bundle, are used to associate the build with the app and version record in App Store Connect. The build string is used to uniquely identify the build throughout the system.

You can also create and upload your build using Xcode Cloud. Xcode Cloud lets you adopt continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), a standard practice that helps monitor and improve software quality over time, ensuring your app or framework is always in a releasable state. [Learn more about Xcode Cloud](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/xcode-cloud).

You also have the option to upload assets that are managed separately from a build by using Apple-Hosted Background Assets. [Learn more.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-asset-packs/overview-of-apple-hosted-asset-packs )

[Learn about upcoming upload requirements.](/news/upcoming-requirements/)

### Upload your app binary files with Xcode

Xcode is Apple’s integrated development environment (IDE). You use Xcode to build apps for Apple products, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro, and Apple Watch. Xcode provides tools to manage your entire development workflow—from creating your app to testing, optimizing, and submitting it for review.

To learn how to upload your app binary using Xcode, visit [Distributing your app for beta testing and releases](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing-your-app-for-beta-testing-and-releases), or in Xcode, choose Help > Xcode Help and search for “Distributing your app for beta testing and releases.”

[Download Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) on the Mac App Store.

### Supported Xcode Versions

App Store Connect supports the following versions of Xcode to upload your app for customer distribution or to testers using TestFlight. You can view delivery progress, including warnings, errors, and delivery logs, as well as a history of past deliveries.

**Note: **Starting in 2026, you'll be required to use Xcode 14 or later to upload your app to App Store Connect.

| Target type | Built using Xcode | Uploaded using Xcode |

## view-acquisition-sources

View App Analytics

# View acquisition sources

App Analytics lets you view data based on where users discover your app or App Clip, so you can determine which sources are most successful at helping you acquire users.

When a user taps a link from an app, website, or App Clip card that directs them to your App Store product page, the immediate product page view is attributed to the referring app, website, or App Clip. If the user subsequently downloads the app for the first time, the resulting First-Time Download is attributed to the original source.

All sales and usage data  for your app or App Clip are attributed to the initial download source recorded when a user first taps to download the app or launch the App Clip. This includes data from redownloads, downloads to multiple devices sharing the same Apple Account, subscription renewals, and Family Sharing downloads.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, Finance, or Sales. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### View app metrics by acquisition source

Viewing your app metrics by source can help you determine which source types are most successful at driving sales and usage.

Source traffic for apps is divided into the following categories:

| Source | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| App Store Search | Users viewed your app or downloaded it from Search on the App Store. Includes views and downloads from ads that appear in App Store search results. |
| App Store Browse | Users viewed your app or tapped to download it while browsing the App Store (for example, in the Today, Games, or Apps sections). |
| App Referrer | Users tapped a link in an app that brought them to your App Store product page. Includes apps using the StoreKit API to load your product page. Includes Apple apps, such as Messages, except Safari. |
| Web Referrer | Users tapped a link from a website that brought them to your App Store product page. If a chain of redirects in Safari leads to your App Store product page, the referring website will be the last URL in the chain.

**Note: **For iOS apps, taps from websites in non-Safari web browsers, such as Chrome, are attributed as that web browser app in App Referrers. For macOS apps, taps from non-Safari web browsers are attributed to Web Referrers. |
| App Clip | Users tapped a link in your App Clip that brought them to your App Store product page. If the user then downloaded your app, the resulting Download is attributed to your App Clip as the source. |
| Institutional Purchases | Users downloaded your app from [Apple Business Manager](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-manager/) or [Apple School Manager](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-school-manager/). |
| Unavailable | Sales and usage data display sources as Unavailable if users downloaded your app before App Analytics started tracking source attribution on April 15, 2017. As users download your app for the first time, more complete source data will display. If a user downloads your app using an App Store gift card, promotional code, or Mobile Device Management software, the source type will also show as Unavailable. |

1. In App Analytics, select the app you want to view.
2. Click Acquisition.
3. The Sources page displays all source data for Product Page Views by default. Use the metric picker on the right side to select a metric and view data.

### View App Clip metrics by invocation source

Viewing your App Clip metrics by invocation source can help you determine which sources are most successful at driving app downloads and engaging users.

Metrics for App Clips, such as App Clip Card Views, App Clip Installations, App Clip Sessions, and App Clip Crashes, are attributed to the initial source that presented the App Clip card to the user. These metrics are only available from users who have agreed to share their diagnostics and usage information with app developers.

Default App Clip experience invocations include Messages and Web Referrer sources. [Learn more.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/configuring_your_app_clip_s_launch_experience)

The following invocation sources are available in App Analytics:

| Source | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Siri | Siri suggested your App Clip in response to a user, they tapped the suggestion, and your App Clip card was displayed. |
| NFC Tags | A user held their iPhone near an NFC tag that you placed at a specific location and your App Clip card was displayed. |
| Maps | A user tapped on a place card in Apple Maps, followed the link to your App Clip, and your App Clip card was displayed. |
| Messages | Your App Clip card was displayed after a user tapped a link they received through the Messages app. |
| QR Code | A user scanned a QR code with their device and your App Clip card was displayed. |
| App Clip Code | A user scanned an App Clip Code with their device and your App Clip card was displayed. |
| Location Based | Your App Clip card was displayed due to the user’s location settings. |
| App Referrer | Your App Clip card was displayed after a user tapped on a link in another app, such as the Notes app or Facebook. Safari, Maps, and Messages aren't included in app referrers. |
| Web Referrer | A user tapped on an invocation URL or Smart App Banner in Safari which invoked the App Clip Card. A detailed breakdown of web referrers is not available. |

1. In App Analytics, select the app you want to view.
2. In the menu bar, click Metrics. By default, the Metrics page displays Product Page Views when you open it.
3. To change the metric displayed, click the metric selector on the top left and choose from the complete list of App Clip metrics. These will only display if your app has a corresponding App Clip.

### FAQs

### How are the metrics driven by Apple Ads (such as app downloads, product page views, and impressions) attributed in App Analytics?

When a user searches for your app using keywords in the Search tab of the App Store and your search results ad appears in the results, the metrics are included in Search totals. If a user doesn’t enter any keywords in Search, and your search results ad appears on the Search page by default, the metrics  are included in Browse totals.

For a guided walkthrough of Apple Ads reporting, check out the “Maximize campaign results with insights” lesson in [Apple Ads Certification](https://ads.apple.com/app-store/certification).

### Why is there a spike in downloads attributed to Institutional Purchases in my App Analytics data?

When your app is [public](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/set-distribution-methods), it'll be publicly available on the App Store in the countries or regions you selected and available to anyone for volume purchase through Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager. Volume purchases generally result in large spikes of downloads because content is purchased in bulk and directly assigned to devices or accounts within a business or educational institution.

Review the [Promo Code field in the Sales and Trends Summary Sales Report](/help/app-store-connect/reference/reporting/summary-sales-report) to confirm if a spike in downloads is due to a volume purchase for business transaction through Apple Business Manager or volume purchase for education transaction through Apple School Manager. Learn more about purchasing content in [Apple Business Manager](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-manager/intro-to-buying-content-axme19b23f7f/1/web/1) and [Apple School Manager](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-school-manager/intro-to-buying-content-axme19b23f7f/web).

# View and manage tester information

If you use TestFlight, you can view information about testers and measure tester engagement. You can also identify, manage, and engage with relevant testers by filtering tester metrics.

Public link metrics allow you to measure the effectiveness of your public link in enrolling testers for your app.

[Learn how to get tester information with the App Store Connect API.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/prerelease_versions_and_beta_testers/beta_testers)

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, App Manager, Developer, or Marketing. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### View tester information

1. In Apps, select the app you want to view.
2. Click the TestFlight tab.
3. In the sidebar, under Testers, click All.
4. In the Status column, view the status of testers. If someone was invited with an invitation email, their name and email address will display. If they were invited with a public link, they’ll display as anonymous.

The possible statuses are:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Invited | The invite was sent to the tester. |
| Accepted | The tester accepted the invite. (You can resend email invites to testers who have not yet accepted.) |

View App Analytics

# View App Clip metrics

App Analytics helps you analyze the performance of your App Clips.

When your App Clip card displays, it’s counted as an App Clip Card View. If the user launches the App Clip by tapping the action button on the App Clip card, the App Clip installs on the user’s device and is counted as an App Clip Installation. It remains on the device until there are 30 consecutive days of inactivity. If the user returns to your App Clip for at least one second, an App Clip Session is counted. If the user clicks a link in your App Clip to download your app from the App Store, the resulting App Unit is attributed to your App Clip as the source, as well as any additional App Clip Sessions or Crashes.

App Clip metrics are only available from users who have agreed to share their diagnostics and usage information with app developers.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, Finance, or Sales. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

## View App Clip metrics

A table appears displaying the different variant sizes.

- The *device type* is the target device for the variant. *Universal* refers to the variant that runs on all supported operating systems and target devices that are delivered to customers running iOS 8 or earlier, apps purchased in volume through Apple School Manager and Apple Business Manager or through [Mobile Device Management (MDM)](https://support.apple.com//guide/deployment/), or apps [downloaded using iTunes 12.6](https://support.apple.com//downloads/itunes) or earlier.
- The *install size* is the amount of disk space the app consumes on the customer’s device. The install size also appears on your app’s product page in the Information section.
- The *download size* is the compressed size of the app that’s downloaded over the air, using cellular bandwidth or Wi-Fi.

If any of the device variant sizes exceed the 200 MB over-the-air download limit, a yellow warning icon appears next to the build string in the Builds table and next to the variant size in the App File Sizes table. Click the warning icon to read the full warning. Apple also sends you an email with this information.

### View build upload status

You can view a build’s version and build number, upload status, and creation date under the Build Uploads section in App Store Connect. The upload status provides detailed insights into delivery progress, including warnings, errors, and other information.

If the upload status of a build is unclear, [submit a Feedback Assistant](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/) ticket (Developer Tools & Resources > TestFlight) or [contact us](https://developer.apple.com/contact/topic/select).

### View the device requirements for a build

Apple calculates the minimum operating system version required for your app to run based on your build settings. You can verify a build's device requirements on the Build Metadata page.

![Screenshot of the Device Requirements section on the iOS Build page which includes minimum iOS, macOS, and visionOS versions, LS minimum system version, supported architectures, device protocols, device family, and required capabilities.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/view-builds-and-metadata/images/build-device-requirements_2x.png)

- The *Minimum iOS version* is the [MinimumOSVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/minimumosversion) provided in your build.
- The *Minimum macOS version* is the minimum version of macOS required for your app to run, as determined by Apple.

Apple automatically calculates the minimum macOS version using the [LSMinimumSystemVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/lsminimumsystemversion) provided in your build, if applicable, and the closest related macOS for the [MinimumOSVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/minimumosversion) provided in your build. If you’ve selected a minimum macOS version in [Pricing and Availability](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/manage-availability-of-iphone-and-ipad-apps-on-macs-with-apple-silicon) and the value is higher than the LSMinimumSystemVersion or the closest related macOS for the MinimumOSVersion, this version will be shown instead.
- The *LS Minimum System Version* is the optional [LSMinimumSystemVersion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/lsminimumsystemversion) provided in your build.

### Download dSYM files

If you include [bitcode](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/11.0/index.html?localePath=en.lproj#/devde46df08a) when you upload your app to App Store Connect, Apple generates debug symbol (dSYM) files, which you’ll need to download in [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/building-your-app-to-include-debugging-information) or App Store Connect before you can view logs in Xcode.

**Note: **Starting with Xcode 14, bitcode is no longer required for tvOS or watchOS apps. Apple no longer accepts bitcode submissions from Xcode 14. dSYM files can only be downloaded for existing bitcode submissions and are no longer available for submissions from Xcode 14 or later.

With App Analytics, you can understand key performance metrics, such as how many users are discovering your In-App Events on the App Store and Apple Games, how successful your In-App Events are at getting users to download your app, as well as how engaged users remain with your app over time.

When a user discovers your In-App Event on the App Store and Apple Games, an Event Impression is counted. If the user already has your app installed and clicks a link from the event to your app, this action counts as an App Open. Users can also opt to receive a reminder just before the event starts. App Analytics counts how many times users tap on those notifications bringing them to your In-App Events.

Getting paid

# View payments and proceeds

Payments and Financial Reports displays a summary of your proceeds for the current fiscal month, and information on sales of your apps and In-App Purchases.

You can also view detailed information for each country or region, such as the number of units sold, the amount earned in that country’s or region's currencies, taxes, and adjustments, the exchange rate applied to the payment, and the total proceeds owed to you displayed in the currency of your bank account.

Proceeds are the amount you'll receive on sales of your apps and In-App Purchases. This is the Customer Price minus applicable taxes and Apple’s commission, per Schedule 2 of your Paid Apps Agreement.

Payment information for the previous fiscal month appears in Payments and Financial Reports starting the first Wednesday of the current fiscal month. Data continues to populate until financial reports are ready for all countries or regions by the first Friday of the current fiscal month.

![Screenshot of sample payments and proceeds.](/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/view-payments-and-proceeds/images/ViewPaymentsandProceeds-1_2x.png)

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, or Finance. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### View payments and estimated proceeds

At the top of the page, either your total estimated proceeds, or the amount paid for that period will display. The amount displayed depends on the month selected, and whether payment for that month has been received.

- **Payment.** If payment has been received, the name of your bank and the last four digits of the account will be displayed under the payment amount. The amount displayed is in your bank account currency.

The date shown indicates when the payment was issued. There is also a Transaction ID, a unique seven-digit payment reference number. This may also be referred to as a Consolidated Credit Identifier (CCI). The CCI number is included as a reference in the additional text provided with the payment transfer details to your bank. If you have questions about a payment, it’s helpful to have the CCI number available when you contact Apple.
- **Total Estimated Proceeds.** If payment hasn’t yet been received for the month you’re viewing, an estimate of your proceeds in your bank account currency will display. This is a consolidated amount owed to you, as of the current date. The actual amount you actually receive may be different. Differences are generally due to changes in the foreign exchange rate by the time of payment, and any applicable withholding tax, which is applied when the payment is made.

Estimated proceeds may display if one of the following has occurred:

- **Expected Payment Date has not yet occurred.** Payment will be dispersed on the date shown in Payments and Financial Reports.
- **Balance Carried Forward. **[Minimum payment threshold](/help/app-store-connect/reference/reporting/minimum-payment-threshold) has not yet been met, meaning your proceeds will carry over to the next payment period.
- **Payment Returned.** If payment was unsuccessful, your action may be needed. Learn how to resolve issues in returned payments.

### View a previous month’s proceeds

1. In the [homepage](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/), click Payments and Financial Reports.
2. In the center, click the month.
3. In the pop-up menu, use the arrows to select a month.

![View previous month’s proceeds](/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/view-payments-and-proceeds/images/ViewPaymentsandProceeds-2_2x.png)

### View your vendor number

You can view your Vendor Number at any time in App Store Connect. Vendor Numbers are needed for downloading reports using the App Store Connect API.

1. In the [homepage](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/), click Payments and Financial Reports.
2. Your Vendor Number appears in the top left hand corner under your Legal Entity Name.

![Screenshot of the Payments and Financial Reports page, with the 'Example Company 1' dropdown menu open at the top left, revealing 'Example Company 1' and 'Vendor # 1234567'.](/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/view-payments-and-proceeds/images/ViewPaymentsandProceeds-3_2x.png)

**Important: **The payment amount shown in App Store Connect represents the amount we've sent to your bank. However, the amount you receive may vary depending on bank fees and transaction costs deducted by your bank or intermediate financial institutions. [Learn more.](/help/app-store-connect/measure-app-performance/overview-of-reporting-tools)

### View proceeds from a different legal entity name or vendor number

The menu at the top left lists legal entity names and associated vendor numbers or revenue streams that have been reported to or paid.

Multiple vendor numbers appearing in the menu indicates that more than one legal entity or revenue stream has been associated with your App Store Connect account. There may be a few reasons why multiple vendor numbers are listed:

- You changed your Legal Entity Name. If you update your Legal Entity Name, the new Legal Entity Name will be assigned a new and unique Vendor Number that is different from the Vendor Number assigned to your old Legal Entity Name. Both Vendor Numbers will be listed so you can view reports for the two legal entities.
- You publish content on Apple News+ or Apple Arcade. If you recently linked your Apple News channel or added Apple Arcade apps to your App Store Connect account and set up tax and banking information, a new and unique Vendor Number will be assigned to those agreements.

To view proceeds from a different legal entity name or vendor number:

1. In the [homepage](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/), click Payments and Financial Reports.
2. On the top left, click the arrow next to your vendor name.
3. Choose from the pop-up menu to view reports for other legal entities. When selecting a vendor number from the menu, the page will update to reflect the financial activity of the assigned entity.

### Resolve a returned payment error

If your bank returns a payment to us, we’ll show you an alert where your proceeds are displayed and also on the App Store Connect homepage, along with the reason the payment was returned, and the bank reference number. You can also [opt in to receive email notifications](/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/view-and-edit-your-profile#set-email-notifications) for returned payments.

Payment Returned alerts will include the following:

- **Reason.** This explains the reasons why your payment may be returned. If our bank lacks specific information regarding the return, we’ll provide any details received from your bank.
- **Required Adjustment.** This includes information on how to fix the problem, or information you’ll need to know to follow up with your bank.

You can often resolve this issue by [updating your banking information](/help/app-store-connect/manage-banking-information/enter-banking-information) in the Business section. If Payment Returned alerts persist after verifying your banking details, please contact your bank to resolve this issue.
- **Transaction ID.** This is a seven-digit payment identifier our bank sends your bank any time we try to make a payment. The bank payment reference number can help your bank identify the attempted payment and explain how to solve the issue so we can send payments to your account. It may also be referred to as a Consolidated Credit Identifier (CCI).

Once you make all necessary updates, payments should resume within two regularly scheduled payment cycles. Returned and held earnings may take up to two payment cycles to resend with a regularly scheduled payment, and will be identified in the Balance column of that payment breakdown. The Payment Returned alert will display until the issue is resolved and we’re able to successfully make a payment to you.

If you've confirmed that your bank account information in App Store Connect is correct, reach out to your bank to resolve why they're not accepting our payments. Use the Transaction ID presented to assist your bank in locating the returned payment.

## view-peer-group-benchmarks

View App Analytics

# View peer group benchmarks

Peer group benchmarks help you put your app’s performance into context by comparing your results to those of apps that are similar to yours.

You can view peer group benchmarks across several key metrics, such as conversion rate, and day 1, day 7, and day 28 retention rates, crash rate, and average proceeds per paying user. These metrics are defined in the same way as [the standard app metrics in App Analytics](/help/app-store-connect/reference/reporting/performance-metrics) and are displayed at weekly intervals.

Compare your app’s performance to the most relevant benchmark using peer groups based on various attributes:

### App Store category

Apps are grouped into peer groups based on their [App Store category](/app-store/categories/). Apps that belong to multiple categories, such as primary and secondary categories, will be included in each category when calculating the respective benchmarks. You can view benchmarks for each category your app belongs to, provided there are enough apps in the group to protect individual app performance, and your app won't appear in unassigned categories. Check your [app information](/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-information) in App Store Connect to see which App Store categories your app is included in.

### App Store business model

Apps are grouped into peer groups based on their [business model](/app-store/business-models/), which include free, freemium, paid, paymium, and subscriptions. Apps with In-App Purchases are considered freemium or paymium. Apps that have an associated cost to download are considered paid or paymium. In order to be considered part of the subscription business model, a freemium or paymium app must generate at least 50% of its revenue from auto-renewable subscriptions. An app’s business model assignment will only switch between the freemium and subscription business models after the app has belonged to the new business model for three consecutive weeks. Other business model changes, such as from free to paid, will occur immediately.

### App Store download volume

Apps with similar levels of download volume in a given week are grouped together into low download volume, medium download volume, and high download volume peer groups. Apps are placed into these groups based on the number of first-time downloads and redownloads they have compared to the rest of the apps in the peer group. Because download volume is assessed within each peer group, your app may fall into different volume tiers across various groups. You can toggle between these peer groups after you click into the detailed view for a specific metric on the Benchmarks tab.

[Learn how to take action on insights from peer group benchmarks.](/app-store/peer-group-benchmarks/)

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, Finance, or Sales. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

### View app benchmark data

1. In App Analytics, select the app you want to view.
2. Click the Benchmarks tab to open the Benchmarks overview page, and compare your app’s performance across a variety of metrics.

Available benchmark metrics include download conversion rate, proceeds per paying user, crash rate, and retention metrics. In each metric widget, you can view how your app compares to your peer group’s 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values.

By default, peer groups for your app's primary App Store category and business model are displayed, showing data from the most recent week benchmarks are available. To view peer groups for subcategories or secondary categories, click the peer group name. To view data for apps in all categories using the same business model as yours, select All Categories.

If your assigned peer group is too small to display a benchmark, select a different group using the category menu. Keep in mind that if your app is a free app, a benchmark for proceeds per paying user won’t display.
3. Click View Trends next to any of the performance metrics to open a detailed view containing a graph that illustrates your app’s performance over time. You can view a more granular peer group by further refining the data by app download volume.

The detailed view opens with the last 26 weeks displayed by default. Click the date picker to select a different date range.
4. Next to Compare To, select a peer group percentile to compare your app against a different percentile value. This returns a dotted line on the graph to illustrate the performance of your peer group's apps compared to yours.

### FAQs

### How does Apple protect the privacy of individual apps in each peer group?

Peer group benchmark values are calculated using a technique called [differential privacy](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/learning-with-privacy-at-scale), which is the gold standard for ensuring that aggregated data remains both helpful and private. Metrics are displayed only when a group's app count meets a minimum threshold, with controlled noise added to data points. This noise decreases as the number of apps in a group increases, maintaining privacy.

### Why does App Analytics display benchmarks for a particular week, but not others?

There are several reasons why benchmark data might show for one week and not another:

- Peer groups require a minimum number of apps in order to show data in a manner that preserves privacy. If the number of apps in the peer group drops below the minimum threshold, data won’t appear for that week.
- Day 28 retention takes longer to calculate than other metrics since it’s a longer duration. When selecting a recent weekly date range, day 28 retention data won’t appear.
- If your app undergoes a change in category or business model and you have selected the previous peer group, the trend line will pause until your app aligns with a new peer group.

### Why does App Analytics display benchmarks for a particular metric, but not others?

The number of benchmarks that display for an app varies based on its relevance to the peer group. Developers can view only the benchmarks relevant to their app category. For example, free apps won’t display a proceeds per paying user benchmark, and Arcade apps will only display crash rate benchmarks in order to avoid showing unhelpful comparisons.

Additionally, a benchmark won’t be shown if it doesn’t meet the privacy threshold. For example, if your app uses a lesser-used business model, such as paid or paidmium, your benchmarks may not all meet the privacy threshold and, as a result, you may observe fewer benchmarks.

### Can I change my peer group?

In most cases, yes.

- Category: If you switch your App Store category, then your peer group comparison will change. You’ll be able to view benchmarks for each App Store category you belong to, as long as there are enough apps in that peer group to ensure individual app performance is protected. If you switch App Store categories, you’ll maintain the ability to access historical benchmark data for the time you were in that category, but you won’t be able to view new benchmark data for that category. You’ll be able to view benchmark data for your new category starting from the week you switched.
- Business model: You can change which business model you’ll be compared against by updating your app’s metadata. If you have In-App Purchases in your metadata, you’ll be considered freemium or paymium. If you don’t have any In-App Purchases and offer your app for free, you’ll be considered free. In order to be considered part of the subscription business model, your app must generate at least 50% of its revenue from auto-renewable subscriptions. Both free and paid apps can be subscription apps.
- Download volume: Apps are placed into download volume groups based on the number of first-time downloads and redownloads they have when compared to the rest of the apps in their peer group. As a result, you can't manually change which download volume groups your app is in. However, App Analytics lets you view peer group benchmarks for any download volume group you want, so you can easily determine what your benchmark would be if you received more or fewer downloads in the future.

### How will benchmark data be impacted if I change my app’s category or business model?

App Analytics detects when you change your app’s category or business model and automatically switches your app to the new peer group. You’ll retain access to historical benchmark data from previous groups, while data from your new group will appear in subsequent weeks. An annotation will appear in the benchmark trends chart when your peer group changes.

### What benchmark data is available for Apple Arcade games?

Apple Arcade games are included in the paid business model peer group and benchmark data is only available for the crash rate metric.

# View product page optimization results

Optimize your App Store product page to determine the most effective version for driving app downloads. These tests use a range of modern and rigorous Bayesian techniques and require minimal overhead to launch a test, transparently communicate changing results as they arrive, and identify the best version as quickly as possible.  This methodology is designed by Apple specifically for App Store product page data, so you can evaluate results every day with the confidence that you’re receiving the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Test results appear in App Analytics after there are five first-time downloads associated with the test. Once a test gathers enough impressions for 90% confidence, a treatment may be marked as Performing Better or Performing Worse, compared to your chosen baseline. (This baseline is the original product page by default, and can be changed to a treatment at any time.) The main measure of performance for each product page version is the conversion rate — the estimated percentage of users that downloaded or pre-ordered your app after viewing the product page. If the amount of data required to reach a high confidence level is more than you’ll likely receive based on your test’s traffic partway through the test, we’ll let you know that your test may be inconclusive.

Test results provide the estimated conversion rate for each variant, the estimated conversion lift between variants, and Apple's confidence level in the results. To calculate this data, Apple takes into account a range of prior information about the performance of your app’s product page. This helps ensure that there’s enough data to report on a difference between your variants.

**Required role: **Account Holder, Admin, Finance, or Sales. [View role permissions.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/account-management/role-permissions)

## View test results

Product page optimization helps you evaluate which version of your product page is most effective at getting users to download your app.

1. In App Analytics, select the app you want to view.
2. Click the Acquisition tab.
3. In the top menu bar, click Product Pages.
4. Click a test’s name in the Product page optimization list. Only the most recent and currently running tests are shown.

The overview of your test’s performance, includes an estimate of which treatment is performing best. By default, your original product page is the baseline. If your test includes multiple treatments, you can change the baseline to one of those treatments. Use the Improvement switch to display results by Improvement or Conversion Rate. Use the menu to view different test results.

Once a test gathers enough impressions to have at least 90% confidence in the results, you can label a treatment as either Performing Better or Performing Worse compared to your chosen baseline. The default baseline is your original product page, but you may change it at any time to any of the available treatments.

The methodology used in product page optimization is described in [Interpretive Adaptive Optimization](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/interpretable-adaptive-optimization).

View Sales and Trends

# View units, proceeds, sales, and pre-orders

Sales and Trends estimates the USD amount of sales and proceeds on the App Store, based on a rolling average of the previous month's exchange rates.

By default, data is shown in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). To match the timezone used by downloaded reports, select Pacific Time (PT). A day includes transactions that happened from 12:00 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. for the selected timezone.

### Units

By default, the Units section display app units, In-App Purchases, and app bundles. You can apply filters to view the number of updates, redownloads, and app units originated from pre-orders.

### App and bundle units

The number of first-time purchases of your app or bundle. An app unit or bundle unit is counted when a customer taps the 'Buy' or 'Get' button for the first-time. Subsequent app updates, downloads to different devices under the same Apple Account, and redownloads to the same device aren't counted as new app units. Family Sharing downloads are counted as app units for free apps but are excluded for paid apps.

### In-App Purchases

The number of In-App Purchases, including consumables, non-consumables, auto-renewable subscriptions, and non-renewable subscriptions. In-App Purchases restored by users aren’t counted. [Learn about the types of In-App Purchase types.](/help/app-store-connect/reference/in-app-purchases-and-subscriptions/in-app-purchase-types)

### Sales

The total amount billed to customers for purchasing apps, app bundles, and In-App Purchases. Sales are inclusive of any applicable taxes we collect and remit per Schedule 2 of the Paid Apps Agreement. Sales for iMessage apps and sticker packs are included in the data for the containing iOS app.

### Proceeds

The amount of money you receive on sales of your apps and In-App Purchases. This is the Customer Price minus applicable taxes and Apple’s commission, per Schedule 2 of your Paid Apps Agreement. Proceeds in Sales and Trends aren’t final. [Learn about final proceeds based on closed transactions.](/help/app-store-connect/getting-paid/overview-of-receiving-payments)

For paid subscriptions active for less than one year, you receive 70% of the subscription price, excluding applicable taxes. This is referred to as the Rate Before One Year.  After a subscriber accumulates one year of paid service, you receive 85% of the subscription price, minus applicable taxes, known as the Rate After One Year.

### Pre-orders

Before releasing your app on the App Store in a country or region for the first time, you can choose to offer it as a pre-order. People can order your app before it’s released and it’ll automatically download onto their devices on release day. A pre-order is counted as an app unit upon fulfillment to a customer. If it's a paid pre-order, the sale is recorded upon fulfillment.

## voice-control-evaluation-criteria

Manage app accessibility

# Voice Control evaluation criteria

iOS
macOS
visionOS

### Description

Using Apple’s Voice Control feature, users with reduced mobility or dexterity can navigate an app’s interface using only their voice. When looking at the screen, they can use commands like “tap," "click," or "swipe" to interact with on-screen elements.

### Goals

		Everyone should be able to use your app, regardless of whether they have a disability. If you can tap, click, or drag something in your app using a mouse or touchscreen gestures, you should strive to make it work with Voice Control, too.
		
**Note: **Most of the work that goes into making your app accessible to ***VoiceOver*** users will also make it more accessible for Voice Control users. For this reason, we recommend you start with the [ VoiceOver evaluation criteria](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/voiceover-evaluation-criteria) before evaluating Voice Control.

The following sections provide more detail about how to determine whether your app supports Voice Control well. The goal is to help ensure users with disabilities can leverage all common tasks of the app, therefore performing this evaluation will help you determine whether to indicate your app **Supports Voice Control** on the App Store. 

### Getting started with testing

In order to accurately indicate support, proficient testing of your app using Voice Control is necessary on all platforms for your app. Even if you already have a basic proficiency in testing with Voice Control, take some time to go beyond the basics. 

Review the resources below to learn more about using Voice Control for each device your app supports. 

- For iPhone, watch [“How to use Voice Control on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg22JaZWAgs) then visit [Use Voice Control commands to interact with iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-voice-control-iph2c21a3c88/ios) and [ Use Voice Control on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111778).
- For iPad, watch [“How to use Voice Control on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg22JaZWAgs) then visit [ Use Voice Control commands to interact with iPad](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/use-voice-control-commands-ipad4b6c9ee4/ipados) and [Use Voice Control on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111778).
- For Mac, visit [Get started with Voice Control on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/get-started-mchl1a04f324/mac).
- For Apple Vision Pro, visit the [Use Voice Control to interact with Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/perform-actions-with-your-voice-tan14d179ad1/visionos).

## Indicating support for Voice Control

You may say your app supports Voice Control if users are able to navigate and interact with your app using only voice commands. Users should be able to complete all of the common tasks, actions, and functions of your app using only Voice Control, without touching the display.

**Using only their voice, users should be able to activate all tappable or clickable elements on the screen.**

- Speak “Show numbers” to make sure all buttons, links, and other interactive elements display a number. 

![iPhone home screen displaying Voice Control’s ‘Show numbers’ overlay. Each app icon is numbered so that the user understands speaking ‘Tap 6’ will launch the Clock app.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/voice-control-evaluation-criteria/images/voice-control-1_2x.png)
- Speak “Show names” to make sure all buttons, links, and other interactive elements display a label, also known as “alternative text.” Refer to the [VoiceOver evaluation criteria](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/voiceover-evaluation-criteria) for more tips on writing good default labels, and review how to [ use accessibilityInputLabels(_:) for Voice Control](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/accessibilityinputlabels(_:)-6nafd).

![iPhone home screen displaying Voice Control’s ‘Show names’ overlay. Each app icon is labeled so that the user understands speaking ‘Tap Clock’ will launch the Clock app.](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/voice-control-evaluation-criteria/images/voice-control-2_2x.png)
- If third-party or user-generated content is required in your common tasks, refer to the detailed guidance for third-party content on the [Overview of Accessibility Nutrition Labels](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels#tips).
- Use commands like “tap” or “click” plus the name or number of a control to drive your app’s common workflows. For example, “Tap Compose,” “Click Back,” or “Tap 4.”
- Match Voice Control labels to the visible text. If the Voice Control label is different from the visible text in your app (for example, “Leave call” instead of “End call”), users may be confused. Your users may be forced to speak “Show names” in order to understand why Voice Control isn’t working as they expected with your app.

**Using only their voice, users should be able to operate all interactions in your app, including those that are more complex.**

- If your app uses swipes, long presses, secondary clicks, or other ways to show additional interactive controls, make sure those are accessible to Voice Control users. For example, use a [custom action](/videos/play/wwdc2019/250/). Elements with custom actions will be indicated with a double chevron; try speaking “Show actions for <number>.”
- If your app reveals a hidden user interface (for example, on hover or swipe), make sure that the user has a speech-only way to show the hidden elements or trigger the same behavior through an action or context menu.
- Ensure scrolling works in your app. For example, “Scroll down.” For panning views like maps or layout canvases, try out speech commands such as “Pan left” and “Zoom out.”
- If other multi-touch gestures are required, try speaking the gesture, such as “Swipe up with two fingers.”
- If your app has a recording option, or if you have a custom dictation function, ensure users can start and stop the recording using only their voice.

**Using only their voice, users should be able to dictate and edit text in any text field.**

- Make sure that users can dictate text in any text field in your app. Speak “type” and the text you’d like to type.
- Try speaking commands like “Select” and the text you want selected. Ensure the text is selected, then speak “Delete that” and verify the text is deleted.
- If you use standard text fields from Apple frameworks, Voice Control will be automatically supported. However, if you use your own custom text entry or a third-party framework, extra work may be required. For example, Apple has an [open-source accessibility plug-in for Unity-based apps](https://github.com/apple/unityplugins/tree/main).
- If your app uses any custom text fields, text entry behavior, or input validation, review and test the rest of Voice Control’s text commands very carefully.

### Additional suggestions

- Some users with physical or cognitive impairments may need more time, or wish to avoid distracting auto-play defaults. If aspects of your app auto-play or auto-hide on a time delay, consider allowing users to cancel or extend that delay.
- Consider implementing [SiriKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SiriKit) and [App Intents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents) to make your app better for all users, including Voice Control users. Review [ “Bring your app to Siri”](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10133/) for more details.

Even after you’re able to indicate support for Voice Control in the common tasks of your app, there are likely further improvements you’ll be able to make to the accessibility of your app. Re-evaluate your app's support for Voice Control every time you update your app. Set a goal to make your app more accessible to more people in every release.

# VoiceOver evaluation criteria

iOS
macOS
tvOS
visionOS
watchOS

### Description

Using Apple’s VoiceOver screen reader, users can navigate an app’s interface without needing to see the screen. Many people who are blind or low vision use VoiceOver to understand and control apps.

### Goals

Everyone should be able to use your app, regardless of whether they have a disability. If you can tap, click, or drag something in your app using a mouse or touchscreen gestures, you should strive to make it work with VoiceOver, too. If you can see an important item on the screen, your app should use a label or description that a VoiceOver user would perceive in audible speech or braille.

**Note: **Most of the work that goes into making your app accessible to ***VoiceOver*** users will also make it more accessible for users of other assistive technologies like Voice Control, Switch Control, and Hover Text. For this reason, we recommend you start your accessibility evaluation with VoiceOver before moving on to test Voice Control.

The following sections provide more detail about how to determine whether your app supports VoiceOver well. The goal is to help ensure users with disabilities can leverage all common tasks of the app, therefore performing this evaluation will help you determine whether to indicate your app **Supports VoiceOver** on the App Store.

### Getting started with testing

In order to accurately evaluate this label, proficient testing of your app using VoiceOver is necessary on all devices your app supports. To ensure your proficiency in testing with VoiceOver, take some time to review the resources below.

Once you’ve learned the basics of VoiceOver, you’re ready to begin testing. However, to ensure the best VoiceOver experience for users, we recommend diving deeper into the user guides to learn about advanced functionality that experienced VoiceOver users may rely on.

## Indicating support for VoiceOver

You may indicate your app supports VoiceOver if users are able to navigate and interact with visual elements, including text, media, buttons, and controls, using only VoiceOver. Using gestures or keyboard commands, users should be able to focus on each part of the UI, hear what it is, and activate it. Make sure users can complete all of the common tasks of your app using only VoiceOver, without sighted assistance.

**All controls should have concise, accurate labels.**

Labels, also known as “alternative text,” help VoiceOver users to quickly understand the purpose of each control or interface element.

- Buttons, icons, form controls, and all other elements should contain a concise label providing a text equivalent for VoiceOver users. Interactive text fields and similar form controls should have a label (for example, “phone number”) in addition to the text value (“555-555-1212”) of the selection or contents.
- Labels should be concise, so that the interface isn’t tedious for a user to navigate and understand quickly. For example, a button for composing a new message should be labeled “New Message” rather than something more verbose like “Press to compose a new message.”
- Ensure the labels make sense out of context. Because VoiceOver users may land on an element in different ways, avoid ambiguous labels that are unclear when the user encounters the item in a non-linear order, such as “Click here” or “Learn more.” If multiple action elements have the same label, like “Delete” in a Shopping Cart, the label text should make it clear what the action will do, especially in the case of destructive actions. For example, which cart item will be deleted?
- Ensure that labels don’t include control types like "checkbox" or states like "checked." Otherwise, VoiceOver may speak redundant information to the user, such as “Unsubscribe **checkbox, checkbox.**” Instead, implement these in your app as [traits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIAccessibilityTraits) or through similar APIs appropriate to the device.
- Most images should include a relevant description or alternative text. If an image is purely decorative, make sure it’s ignored completely by VoiceOver.
- If your app provides a way for users to upload media, such as images, ensure users have a way to include labels or descriptions for the user-generated content, so that VoiceOver users can hear this description when encountering the media.
- Charts and other data visualizations should include accessibility information through a more specific chart API, or at minimum, include a reasonably complete text alternative.
- If third-party or user-generated content is required in your common tasks, refer to the detailed guidance for third-party content on the [Overview of Accessibility Nutrition Labels](/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels#tips).
- For more ideas, watch [“Writing Great Accessibility Labels“](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/254/) and ["Bring accessibility to charts in your app."](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10122/)

**VoiceOver users should be aware of element type and control status or value.**

People who rely on VoiceOver often need to hear more information than just labels and text content, since the status or value may be conveyed only through visual means such as a checked box. Implement this information in your app as [traits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIAccessibilityTraits)  or through similar APIs appropriate to the device.

- When a VoiceOver user lands on an item, VoiceOver should speak the type of element in addition to the label or text content. For example, “Unsubscribe from all emails, **checkbox**."
- Users should be able to understand control state and values. Keep in mind that default states, like the “unchecked” state of a checkbox, are implied so they may not be spoken by VoiceOver. For example, “Unsubscribe from all emails, checkbox.” Additionally, take care to update the API for control state and values. For example, once the user has checked the checkbox, VoiceOver will describe the control, including its new state, as, “Unsubscribe from all emails, **checked** checkbox."

**VoiceOver should be able to speak all visible text in your app, and all text entry methods should be operable by VoiceOver users.**

The accessibility of most visible text will be automatically supported when using Apple frameworks. However, if your app uses another framework, or custom text entry methods, extra work may be required. For example, Apple has an [open-source accessibility plug-in for Unity-based apps](https://github.com/apple/unityplugins/tree/main).

- All visible text in the app should be accessible to assistive technologies, including VoiceOver. Plain text elements, such as paragraphs, don’t need a separate label, though you should ensure that VoiceOver can speak the text content.
- Custom keyboards and text entry methods (for example, custom keyboards or PIN code entry widgets) should be operable with VoiceOver, and produce correct speech/braille output for the user, in addition to providing accurate text entry and selection.
- Temporary status banners and important in-app alerts should be conveyed to VoiceOver users in a timely but non-disruptive manner, often done so with an [AccessibilityNotification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accessibility/accessibilitynotification).

**VoiceOver navigation and grouping should be consistent, complete, and use a logical order.**

VoiceOver users should be able to navigate in page order, or move directly to a part of the screen using features like the VoiceOver rotors.

- VoiceOver users should be able to navigate **to** any visible element, either in order (swipe right, VO+Right, and so on) or by using a rotor and touch navigation on most platforms.
- VoiceOver users should be able to navigate **away** from the element they are on, whether by continuing forward, going backward (Swipe Left, VO+Left, etc), or by using a rotor or touch navigation on most platforms.
- If multiple elements or actions are presented as a group, VoiceOver users should be able to either move to each item in the group, or be able to interact with the grouped behaviors (for example, reply, forward, delete) through features like [custom actions](/videos/play/wwdc2019/250/).
- VoiceOver users should be able to progress to each element without skipping items or looping back to the same item repeatedly. Try navigating forward through all contents, then backwards through all contents. Try looping through all rotor items forward and backwards, too.
- When content reloads or refreshes in the background, a VoiceOver user’s reading position shouldn’t reset unexpectedly. For example, if a VoiceOver user is near the bottom of a content feed when the app loads more content, the VoiceOver cursor shouldn’t accidentally reset to the top of the list.
- When the screen changes or a modal dialog appears, the VoiceOver cursor should move logically into the new content area. VoiceOver users shouldn’t be able to move into invisible, offscreen, or background content.

**All interactive elements and controls should be discoverable, operable, and work consistently with VoiceOver.**

As a reminder, if you can tap, click, or drag something in your app using a mouse or touchscreen gestures, you should make it work with VoiceOver, too.

- VoiceOver’s activation gesture (select then double-tap) and keyboard command (VO+space) should trigger the same behavior as a standard tap or click.
- Standard keyboard operations (for example, arrow keys) and keyboard modifier shortcuts should continue to work, even when VoiceOver is active, and the VoiceOver cursor should follow changes triggered by standard keyboard navigation like the Tab key, arrow keys, and more.
- If your app’s controls provide a context menu, overload a long press, or provide other non-default behaviors, consider providing the same behaviors as a [custom action ](/videos/play/wwdc2019/250/)using VoiceOver’s actions rotor or its equivalent “show context menu” keyboard command (VO+Shift+M).
- VoiceOver should work with modal views, like dialogs. Apps should ensure that inactive content behind the modal view isn’t accessible to VoiceOver while the content is inactive. Apps should also support VoiceOver users being able to dismiss modal views, like closing the dialog, using the Escape key or an [accessibilityPerformEscape](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject-swift.class/accessibilityperformescape()) action.
- Complex app behaviors, such as drag and drop or multi-touch gestures, should be provided in an accessible, discoverable way, such as through a custom rotor or action. Whenever possible, use the Apple-provided native API to reduce implementation complexity.
- Custom elements, if used by the app or any included frameworks, should provide equivalent accessibility of native elements provided by the Apple UIKit, AppKit, and SwiftUI frameworks. For example, custom buttons, tab bars, and sliders should be operable with VoiceOver and convey the same information as controls using standard API equivalents.

Even after you’re able to indicate support for VoiceOver in the common tasks of your app, there are likely further improvements you’ll be able to make to the accessibility of your app. Re-evaluate your app's support for VoiceOver every time you update your app. Set a goal to make your app more accessible to more people in every release.
